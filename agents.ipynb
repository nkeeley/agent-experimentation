The\\nrelease of ChatGPT, however, has accelerated discourse on the societal impacts of synthetic media.\\nThis study first highlights several gaps within existing literature on synthetic media, structuring the\\nimpact potential and limitations of synthetic media threats within a theoretical framework. Second, it\\nidentifies financial information environments as prime candidates for future disruption via synthetic\\ntext modalities, proposing an experimental survey for measuring the influential power of synthetic\\nfinancial text on global investment communities. Rather than merely assessing the ability of survey\\nparticipants to distinguish genuine from synthetic text, the experiment contained within this study\\nmeasures synthetic media influence by observing its ability to manipulate belief via a series of\\nbehavioral variables. The results indicate that synthetic text can significantly shift investor sentiment\\naway from what it might otherwise have been under truthful information conditions. Furthermore,\\nsynthetic financial text demonstrated a unique ability to “convert\" investors, inspiringextreme changes\\nin outlook about a company compared to genuine financial texts. This trend should inspire concern\\nwithin the global financial community, particularly given the historical vulnerability of equity markets\\nto investor sentiment shocks. 1\\nKeywords synthetic media · deepfake · ChatGPT · influence · investment\\n1Please send correspondence to ngkeeley8@gmail.com. In order to meet preprint specifications, this paper was adapted from its\\noriginal format, as submitted to Tsinghua University in partial fulfillment of the requirement for the degree of Master of Management\\nScience in Global Affairs.\\narXiv:2306.05033v1  [cs.CY]  8 Jun 2023'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 1: Anonymous image of China’s Covid Zero re-\\nopening on Twitter (“How a Mysterious China Screenshot\\nSpurred $450 Billion Rally,” 2022).\\n1 Introduction\\n1.1 The Significance of Two Events, One World\\nApart\\nIn November of 2022, two seemingly disconnected events\\non opposite ends of the world brushed paths in time. One\\ngenerated $450 billion USD, while another revolutionized\\nmodern technology. But together, they may foreshadow a\\ndark future for the global financial world.\\nThe first of these events was triggered by the dissemination\\nof an anonymous screenshot on China’s most prominent\\nsocial media application, WeChat 微信. The image con-\\ntained a piece of paper with four paragraphs of Chinese\\ncharacters, detailing the intended loosening of China’s\\nCovid Zero policy. Nobody verified the image’s authentic-\\nity or identified an original author, yet the image managed\\nto spread from WeChat, to investment forums on Twitter,\\nand ultimately to Chinese trading platform, Xueqiu 雪\\n球 (“How a Mysterious China Screenshot Spurred $450\\nBillion Rally,” 2022). Although Chinese officials did not\\nofficially repeal the Covid Zero policy until over a month\\nlater (Zhu et al., 2023), the image inspired enough trading\\nactivity to shift equity markets by almost half a trillion\\ndollars.\\nThe second of these events occurred in America: the re-\\nlease of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Since then, the large language\\nmodel (LLM) chatbot has become “the fastest-growing\\nconsumer application in history,” accruing an average user\\ncount of 13 million per month (Hu, 2023). While its users\\nhave developed countless innovative use-cases for Chat-\\nGPT, researchers have grown increasingly concerned about\\nits ability to spread misinformation online (Hsu & Thomp-\\nson, 2023).\\nThis study examines the impact of synthetic media on so-\\nciety, and while ChatGPT and the anonymous text passage\\ndescribed above were released separately, the possibility\\nof their convergence portends a frightening reality for the\\nfinancial world which may rapidly be coming to fruition.\\nThe use of these two events also highlights the significance\\nof synthetic media as an area of study, as well as several\\ncharacteristics that render it more nuanced than it might\\ninitially appear.\\nFirst, synthetic content generation lies at the confluence of\\nseveral expansive subject domains, including cutting-edge\\nmachine learning techniques (e.g. LLMs), epistemologi-\\ncal questions about authenticity and credibility, and even\\nethical considerations (e.g. free speech protections).\\nSecond, the examples reaffirm that this is a global problem,\\nnot a localized one. Language models developed in one\\ncountry can be used to generate content in another, and\\nthe financial effects that result can yield economic impacts\\nthat transcend international boundaries.\\nThird, the anonymous screenshot described above was\\nnot just an image, but an image of text. While this study\\nfocuses on synthetic text, the anonymous screenshot serves\\nas a reminder that synthetic media has multiple modalities;\\nit can consist of videos, images, audio files, text, or even a\\ncombination thereof.\\nFinally, the positive and negative externalities of both\\nevents underscore that the moral value judgments underly-\\ning synthetic media are difficult to disentangle. Indeed, this\\npaper deliberately employs the phrase “synthetic media”2\\n(Bateman, 2020) instead of “deepfake” to avoid negative\\nbiases embedded within preexisting (primarily English)\\nliterature, to prevent the conflation of truth value with\\nprovenance integrity, to acknowledge the subjectivity sepa-\\nrating media augmentation from media manipulation, and\\nto encompass the many methods of delivery and modali-\\nties that synthetic media can take. Furthermore, the term\\n“media” implies content that is intended to impart informa-\\ntion, while the term “synthetic” underscores a difference\\nwith manually-produced media – a distinction described in\\nmore detail in Chapter 2.\\n1.2 Research Questions\\nThe primary research question of this study was to de-\\ntermine if ChatGPT generates synthetic financial disin-\\nformation that is more persuasive than genuine financial\\ninformation:\\n2In reality, this phrase has many names within existing litera-\\nture, including “deepfakes” (Helmus, 2022), “AI-generated con-\\ntent” (Cao et al., 2023), “machine generated” content (Crothers et\\nal., 2023) “deep synthesis information content” 深度合成信息\\n内容(《互联网信息服务深度合成管理规定》答记者问-中\\n共中央网络安全和信息化委员会办公室, 2022), etc.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\n• H1: GPT-3.53 produces synthetic financial disin-\\nformation that is more persuasive than genuine\\nfinancial information.\\nIn addition to statistically testing the main hypothesis,\\nthis study conducted exploratory analysis of several\\nsub-hypotheses in parallel:\\n• H2: GPT-3.5 produces synthetic financial\\ndisinformation that has more persuasive power\\nthan synthetic world news disinformation.\\n• H3: Synthetic financial disinformation about\\nniche industries is more persuasive than that of\\nnon-niche industries.\\n2 Literature Review\\n2.1 Defining Synthetic Media: Avoiding Detection By\\nHumans and Machines\\nThe history of media alteration dates back to the origins\\nof photography (Verdoliva, 2020; Digital Forensics, 2008;\\nChesney & Citron, 2019). For example, the first permanent\\nphotograph in history was taken in 1828 (Digital Forensics,\\n2008). Less than forty years later, a photograph of Pres-\\nident Abraham Lincoln emerged which had been crafted\\nby splicing portions of two different images. Doctoring\\nconvincing images has since grown more accessible and ef-\\nfective via technology applications, such as Adobe’s suite\\nof “Photoshop” tools (Verdoliva, 2020; Chesney & Citron,\\n2019). This kind of traditional media alteration can be\\nhighly convincing if carried out professionally (Verdoliva,\\n2020). However, it is distinct in that it is manual in nature.\\nConversely, the term “synthetic media” refers to images,\\nvideos, audio files, and text that are entirely generated via\\nartificial intelligence (Bateman, 2020). When produced\\ncorrectly, synthetic media can be so convincing that it de-\\nceives not only the naked eye (Helmus, 2022), but also\\nadvanced detection algorithms (Deepfake Detection Chal-\\nlenge Results, 2020) - which may otherwise have served\\nas societal safety nets for human bias and error.\\nFor example, multiple empirical studies demonstrate that\\nhumans perform no better than guessing when they are\\ndistinguishing between synthetic and genuine videos, im-\\nages, audio files, and text (Bray et al., 2022; Korshunov\\n& Marcel, 2020; Mai et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020). In\\nfact, one study suggests that human subjects mislabel over\\n75% of high-quality synthetic videos as genuine footage\\n(Korshunov & Marcel, 2020).4 Unfortunately, detection\\nalgorithms used by organizations to sift through disinfor-\\nmation at-scale (Morrish, 2023; Deepfake Detection Chal-\\n3As described later in more detail, GPT-3.5 is the model upon\\nwhich ChatGPT was originally built and corresponds with the\\nversion of ChatGPT used for this study’s experimental survey.\\n4Another study found these results to be robust to language\\ndifferences - specifically Chinese and English (Mai et al., 2023)\\nlenge Results, 2020) have also struggled to reliably classify\\nsynthetic media. As a prime example, social media giant\\nMeta partnered with Microsoft and multiple global univer-\\nsities in 2020 to host the “Deepfake Detection Challenge”\\n(DFDC). Over 2,000 applicants submitted 35,000 detection\\nmodels. Yet the highest performing model only achieved\\nan accuracy rating of 65.18% on “real world” synthetic\\nvideo detection (Deepfake Detection Challenge Results,\\n2020). Similar results have been demonstrated empirically\\nfor detecting synthetic images, audio files, and text (Du et\\nal., 2020; Müller et al., 2022; Pu et al., 2022).\\nThe ability of synthetic media to bypass both humanand al-\\ngorithmic detection distinguishes it from manually-altered\\nmedia, and is a distinction worth underscoring again, con-\\nsidering the ease with which it can be overlooked. The\\nreason behind this comparative advantage is better under-\\nstood through the evolutionary history of synthetic media\\ncreation algorithms, and the “generalization problem\" that\\nhas accompanied it.\\n2.2 The Evolution of Synthetic Media Creation and\\nthe “Generalization Problem\"\\nOne of the more commonly used terms in preexisting En-\\nglish literature on synthetic media is the term “deepfake.”\\nIt was coined by a Reddit user in 2017 (Somers, 2020)\\nwho developed a technique for superimposing the faces\\nof celebrities onto pornographic videos using “deep” ma-\\nchine learning models called “neural network[s]” (Chesney\\n& Citron, 2019). Broadly speaking, neural networks are\\nstatistical models that mimic the synaptic architecture of\\nthe human brain to form predictions (Chesney & Citron,\\n2019). The earliest deepfakes were formed by combining\\none neural network’s inputs (trained to translate celebrity\\nfaces into an embedding vector) with another neural net-\\nwork’s outputs (trained to translate embedding vectors into\\npornographic videos) (Nguyen et al., 2022; BM, 2022).\\nSince 2017, methodological advancements to the neural\\narchitectures underlying deepfakes have significantly am-\\nplified the quality of synthetic media products – as well as\\ntheir ability to elude detection. For audio-visual modalities,\\none of the first major milestones included the application\\nof “Generative Adversarial Networks” (GANs). Devel-\\noped by Google researcher Ian Goodfellow, GANs pit a\\n“forger” neural network against a “detector” neural net-\\nwork in a prolonged competition, ultimately generating a\\nhighly convincing synthetic product that can deceive detec-\\ntion algorithms (Helmus, 2022; Chesney & Citron, 2019).\\nAdditional methods within the synthetic audio-visual do-\\nmain include Variational Auto-Encoders (V AEs), as well\\nas generative diffusion models, introduced by Stability.AI\\nin 2022 (Cao et al., 2023).\\nFrom a synthetic text perspective, the first adaptation of\\nneural network architecture was the introduction of Re-\\ncurrent Neural Networks (RNN), allowing for the use of\\nlonger input phrases (Cao et al., 2023). Next came the\\ndevelopment of mechanisms for incorporating “memory”\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\ninto a network’s statistical weighting process, including\\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent\\nUnits (GRU) (Cao et al., 2023). However, arguably one\\nof the most important milestones in the history of syn-\\nthetic text development was the adaptation and use of the\\n“Transformer” architecture, proposed by Vaswani et al.\\n(Cao et al., 2023; Crothers et al., 2023; Vaswani et al.,\\n2017). The Transformer architecture, currently hailed as\\n“the state-of-the-art in natural language generation across\\nnatural language tasks” (Crothers et al., 2023), incorpo-\\nrates a “multi-head attention” mechanism that allows mod-\\nels to efficiently focus on the most important portions of\\na text input and output (Crothers et al., 2023; Cao et al.,\\n2023; Brown et al., 2020; Ruby, 2023). Consequently, an\\n“overwhelming majority” (Crothers et al., 2023) of modern\\ngenerative language models have adopted it – including\\nthe one underlying ChatGPT.5\\nChatGPT, which was released by OpenAI in November\\nof 2022 (Ruby, 2023), allows users to type chatbot-style\\nquestions and receive immediate feedback. Its interface\\nwas technically built upon OpenAI’s “GPT-3.5” series of\\nlanguage models; however, these models are merely slight\\nimprovements on GPT-3 – their “core” model (Introducing\\nChatGPT, 2022; OpenAI, n.d.; New GPT-3 Capabilities,\\n2022).6 Two factors distinguished GPT-3 from its prede-\\ncessor, which possessed an almost identical architectural\\nframework. First, GPT-3’s architecture grew exponentially\\nin size – from 1.5 billion parameters (GPT-2), to approxi-\\nmately 175 billion parameters (Cao et al., 2023). Second,\\nthe data used for model pre-training grew from 38 giga-\\nbytes (GPT-2), to 570 gigabytes (Cao et al., 2023). This\\njump in scale, the model’s creators found, led to rapid in-\\ncreases in the efficient handling of “in-context information”\\n(Brown et al., 2020). Coupled with human-augmented\\nreinforcement learning (Cao et al., 2023) and a free, user-\\nfriendly interface, ChatGPT seized news headlines for\\nmonths following its release as users found innovative\\n– as well as concerning – applications of its technology\\n(Roose, 2022; Huang, 2023).\\nThe continuous development of new generative models and\\n“adversarial [techniques] that fool detection algorithms”\\n(Crothers et al., 2023) described above has surfaced a sig-\\nnificant obstacle for automated synthetic media detection.\\nReferred to here as “the generalization problem,\" this phe-\\nnomenon describes the tendency of detection algorithms\\nto struggle while labeling real-world synthetic content cre-\\nated by newly emergent models and methods (Deepfake\\nDetection Challenge Results, 2020; Du et al., 2020; Müller\\n5In fact, audio-visual models have also adopted Transformer\\narchitectures, such as Swin Transformer and Vision Transformer.\\nThe use of this architecture across models of differing modalities\\nhas also enabled the creation of “multimodal models” (e.g. CLIP\\nand DALL-E-2), which can perform cross-modality tasks such as\\n“text-to-image generation” (Cao et al., 2023).\\n6GPT stands for “Generative Pre-trained Transformer”\\n(Crothers et al., 2023). Since this publication, ChatGPT Plus\\n– ChatGPT’s paid version – has also begun accepting inputs from\\nits newest model: GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023).\\net al., 2022; Pu et al., 2022).7 In this condition, detection\\nalgorithms can be described as “fail[ing] to generalize”\\nto real-world data (Pu et al., 2022; Deepfake Detection\\nChallenge Results, 2020; ). For example, one study on fal-\\nsified audio-file detection reported “[model] performance\\ndegradation of up to one thousand percent” when exposed\\nto new synthetic content (Müller et al., 2022). Even Ope-\\nnAI’s most recent synthetic text detection algorithm only\\naccurately classified 26% of the data it was evaluated on\\n(Kirchner et al., 2023). The generalization problem has\\nlocked synthetic media generators and detectors into a\\nperpetual technology “arms race” (Helmus, 2022). As a\\nresult, synthetic media detection via algorithmic means\\nis, as described in Meta’s DFDC results summary, “still\\nvery much an unsolved problem” (Deepfake Detection\\nChallenge Results, 2020).\\n2.3 A History of Synthetic Media Use: Trending\\nTowards Politics\\nWhile understanding the evolution of synthetic content gen-\\neration reveals important insights about the advantages and\\nlimits of their implementation, examining trends across\\npublicized synthetic media use-cases sheds light on the\\nobjectives behind their use. The section that follows ex-\\namines both socially beneficial and deliberately malicious\\nsynthetic media use-cases that are either mentioned in pre-\\nexisting literature, or sensationalized in the news. For\\nsimplicity, it does so by dividing the four synthetic media\\nmodalities into two categories: audio-visual (video, im-\\nage, audio), and text. Of special note to later analysis, a\\ndominant proportion of malicious use-cases, across both\\ncategories, tend to involve politics.\\n2.3.1 Audio-Visual Use-Cases\\nPerhaps the most commonly cited synthetic media products\\non the internet today are satirical videos mimicking former\\nPresident Obama (Vincent, 2018; BuzzFeedVideo, 2018)\\nand actor Tom Cruise (Helmus, 2022; Vecanoi, 2021).\\nThese videos have garnered millions of views online. How-\\never, synthetic media applications have also extended to\\nuse-cases with higher stakes. For instance, political can-\\ndidates in both India and Korea have leveraged synthetic\\nmedia to amplify the effectiveness of their digital cam-\\npaigns. In 2020, Indian parliamentary candidate Manoj\\nTiwari “used a ‘lip-synch’ deepfake algorithm” (Lyons,\\n2020) to \"speak” a dialect he couldn’t naturally speak.\\nThe tactic allowed him to reach 15 million Indian voters\\n“he might not have otherwise been able to reach” (Lyons,\\n2020). Two years later, advisors to South Korean presi-\\ndential candidate (now current president) Yoon Suk-yeol\\npublished campaign videos using his more youthful “deep-\\n7One anecdote captures this phenomenon in practice partic-\\nularly clearly. In 2018, researchers openly published a paper\\nidentifying subject blink rates as a critical feature for distinguish-\\ning synthetic from genuine videos. Within several weeks, new\\nsynthetic media emerged from malign algorithms specifically\\nadapted to incorporate realistic blink rates (Helmus, 2022).\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 2: Screenshot of Tom Cruise “deepfake\" (Vecanoi,\\n2021).\\nfake avatar,” (Shin & Yi, 2022) raising public opinion\\nratings for young adults by 10% (Shin & Yi, 2022).\\nMultiple international companies have also commercial-\\nized synthetic media to serve their consumers. Most no-\\ntably in China, technology firm Momo Inc. 陌陌技术有\\n限公司released the ZAO mobile application in September\\nof 2019, allowing users to superimpose their faces onto the\\nimages of celebrities (Horwitz, 2019). During its week-\\nend release, millions of downloads led to the application\\nbecoming the most popular free application on China’s\\niPhone App Store (Horwitz, 2019). Though the applica-\\ntion is no longer made available by Apple due to user\\nprivacy complaints (Horwitz, 2019) and an intervention by\\nChina’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology\\n(Regulating Tech Use to Curb “deepfake” Risks, 2022),\\nZAO’s service has been replicated in multiple other com-\\npanies since, to include Russia’s FaceApp (Stokel-Walker,\\n2019), America’s Snapchat (Nuñez, 2020), and China’s\\nTikTok (Nuñez, 2020).\\nMore recent studies suggest that these same features may\\nbe capable of fulfilling consumer needs in the healthcare\\nsector, too. For instance, sexual assault survivors have\\ndonned virtual reality headsets to undergo trial exposure\\ntherapy in synthetically generated digital environments\\n(Wiederhold, 2021; van Minnen et al., 2022).\\nUnfortunately, the urgency within existing literature for\\ndetecting synthetic media typically stems from more in-\\nsidious use-cases that are increasingly frequent – not to\\nmention damaging (Hwang, 2020; Helmus, 2022; Chesney\\n& Citron, 2019; Sensity, 2019). For example, according\\nto a report generated by Sensity (formerly “Deeptrace”),\\nthe number of synthetically produced videos online in-\\ncreased from almost 8,000 to 14,678 between 2018 and\\n2019. Of these videos, an overwhelming proportion rep-\\nresented pornographic content, garnering over 13 million\\nviews (Sensity, 2019). While the vast majority of subjects\\nin these videos were high-profile, international celebrities,\\n100% of the videos targeted women – revealing reputa-\\nFigure 3: Genuine President Zelensky photos vs. deepfake\\nscreenshot (AI Index Report 2023 – Artificial Intelligence\\nIndex, 2023).\\ntional damage severely concentrated along gender lines\\n(Chesney & Citron, 2019; Sensity, 2019).\\nFraud and theft have also been attributed to the malicious\\nuse of synthetic media. In 2019, thieves used algorithmi-\\ncally altered voiceovers to convince the Chief Executive\\nOfficer (CEO) of a British business to transfer $200,000 to\\nfake accounts (Damiani, 2019). Two years later, another\\nbusinessman mistakenly transferred over $35 million to\\nfraudsters via a similar scheme (Brewster, 2021).\\nHowever, manipulation of political information environ-\\nments – both domestically, and internationally – represents\\nthe largest focal point of preexisting literature on synthetic,\\naudio-visual media. According to the “AI, Algorithmic and\\nAutomation Incidents and Controversies” (AIAAIC) repos-\\nitory, political content accounted for 34.7% of audio-visual\\ndeepfakes since 2018 – the single largest category other\\nthan “Media/entertainment/sports/arts” at 40.3% (AIAAIC\\n- AI and Algorithmic Incidents and Controversies, 2019).8\\nThe most recent – and perhaps shocking – example oc-\\ncurred in March of 2022 (AI Index Report 2023 – Artifi-\\ncial Intelligence Index, 2023; Simonite, 2022). Less than\\na month after Russian forces invaded Ukraine, a video of\\nPresident Vladimir Zelensky standing wearily behind a\\npodium emerged on Ukrainian national media outlets. In\\nthe video, he “call[ed] on his soldiers to lay down their\\nweapons,” formally announcing the surrender of his coun-\\ntry (Mikael Thalen [MikaelThalen], 2022). Of course,\\nthe video was later determined as a fake, generated to\\nmimic Zelensky’s facial structure, tone of voice, and even\\neye movements (Simonite, 2022; Wakefield, 2022; Allyn,\\n2022). While international social media channels fortu-\\nnately reacted quickly in discrediting the video as a Rus-\\nsian information warfare tactic (Academic Webinar, 2022),\\nits publication demarcates one of the first documented, in-\\nternational “weaponizations” of synthetic media in modern\\nhistory (Simonite, 2022).\\nPolitically motivated synthetic videos have emerged else-\\nwhere in the world, too. For instance, in 2018, allegations\\nabout a government-sponsored “deepfake” fueled a domes-\\ntic coup in Gabon (Transcript - Why the Zelensky Deep-\\n8Calculated by filtering “Sector(s)” column for entries con-\\ntaining the term “Politics” or “Govt.”\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 4: (a) Original Tacoma map tile; (b) Original\\nTacoma satellite image; (c) Fake Tacoma image with Seat-\\ntle landscape features; (d) Fake Tacoma image with Beijing\\nlandscape features (Zhao et al., 2021).\\nfake Failed, 2022). Although the coup was suppressed, the\\nincumbent administration never released evidence denying\\nclaims of synthetic media creation, and the video’s authen-\\nticity remains in question to this day (Transcript - Why\\nthe Zelensky Deepfake Failed, 2022). In 2021, a similarly\\nquestionable video implicating government leader Aung\\nSan Suu Kyi in a bribery accusation surfaced in Myan-\\nmar (Gregory, 2021). Meanwhile, synthetically generated\\nsatellite images have been labeled as a potential national\\nsecurity threat (Zhao et al., 2021), and the specter of artifi-\\ncial intelligence looms over manual disinformation wars\\n– such as the one that raged in Tigray until only recently\\n(Ethiopia’s Warring Sides Locked in Disinformation Battle,\\n2021; Hiebert, 2022).\\n2.4 Text Use-Cases\\nAs seen in Section 2.2, the evolutionary timeline of syn-\\nthetic media generation spans less than a decade. As a\\nresult, the history of its use is short. The list of sensation-\\nalized synthetic text use-cases is even shorter – eclipsed\\nby concerns about audio-visual “deepfakes.”9 For example,\\nthe “Deepfakes: Grounded Threat Assessment” published\\nby Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Tech-\\nnology (CSET) in 2020 even explicitly “eschew[ed] a close\\nexamination of ML-driven text generation” (Hwang, 2020).\\nThis may seem ironic to readers in hindsight, given Chat-\\nGPT’s current spotlight in the technology world. However,\\nthe inattention by CSET and other authors of preexisting\\nliterature underscores the speed with which LLMs and syn-\\nthetically generated content have entered the public eye, as\\nwell as the lack of historical data on its use.\\n9See (Chesney & Citron, 2019; Verdoliva, 2020; Hwang,\\n2020; Gregory, 2021; Helmus, 2022; Hiebert, 2022) for evidence\\nof this imbalance.\\nThe earliest origins of natural language generation began\\nin the mid-20th century, spurred by the pursuit of language\\ntranslation using machines (Jones, 2001). Following sev-\\neral decades of rudimentary attempts to build Q&A-style\\nsystems, “statistical language processing” finally became\\na dominant element of natural language generation in the\\n1990s (Jones, 2001). In 2016, a study on synthetic text de-\\ntection suggested that use-cases were limited in scope from\\n“basic random word salads to web scraping” (Beresneva,\\n2016). “The biggest part of artificial content,” it contin-\\nued, “is generated for nourishing fake web sites designed\\nto offset search engine indexes” (Beresneva, 2016).\\nSince then, the development of language models and gener-\\native techniques – particularly the Transformer architecture\\n– has increased both the number and variety of synthetic\\nmedia use-cases. However, like their audio-visual coun-\\nterparts, malicious uses of synthetic text seem to predomi-\\nnantly revolve around the political domain. For example,\\nWired magazine wrote about a cybersecurity company’s\\nuse of GPT-2 to simulate an autonomous version of Rus-\\nsia’s election-tampering attempts in 2016 (Simonite, 2019;\\nHelmus, 2022). In 2020, The Guardian rapidly (and clev-\\nerly) popularized GPT-3 by using the model to write an\\narticle about its own capabilities (“A Robot Wrote This En-\\ntire Article. Are You Scared Yet, Human?,” 2020; Helmus,\\n2022). GPT-2 and GPT-3 have also sparked controversy\\nin the AI research community due to their questionable\\nuse in online forums. The former language model was\\nonce used to generate over 1,000 comments on Medi-\\ncaid’s government website - indistinguishable from hu-\\nman comments, according to subjects in an experiment\\ncarried out in 2019 (Weiss, 2019; Crothers et al., 2023).\\nSimilarly, a model adapted from GPT-3 was used to gen-\\nerate over 30,000 racially and politically insensitive posts\\non one of 4chan’s anonymous politics threads in 2022\\n(Kurenkov, 2022; Crothers et al., 2023). Following a\\nsigned condemnation of the model by hundreds of sig-\\nnatories in the AI community (Crothers et al., 2023), the\\nmodel was removed from opensource-AI hub “Hugging\\nFace” (Kurenkov, 2022; Crothers et al., 2023).\\nIn fairness, generative language models have also previ-\\nously been attributed with a variety of societally benefi-\\ncial tasks, including translating documents, creating text\\nsummaries, building cover letters, and serving as digital\\nassistants (Crothers et al., 2023). As a user-friendly, pub-\\nlicly available tool, ChatGPT’s release has undoubtedly\\naccelerated the proliferation of such uses cases, as well\\nas obfuscated the boundary between “good” and “bad”\\nuses. Indeed, ChatGPT has since been used to create po-\\netry, comedy, essays, and even software (Roose, 2022).\\nHowever, it has also raised concerns about facilitating pla-\\ngiarism (Huang, 2023), introducing AI sentience (Roose,\\n2023), and amplifying the availability of misinformation\\n(Hsu & Thompson, 2023).\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\n2.5 Asymmetries, Contradictions, and Gaps in\\nExisting Literature\\nPreexisting literature on synthetic media varies widely\\nalong multiple dimensions, to include technical depth, con-\\nsistency, and value judgment. As alluded to in the preced-\\ning sections, this academic landscape is further compli-\\ncated by asymmetrical attention to political information\\nenvironments, as well as limited historical data. These\\ncharacteristics can introduce contradictions and confusion\\nabout crucially relevant questions, such as evaluating the\\nthreat potential of synthetic media, quantifying its possible\\nimpact, and identifying vulnerable targets.\\nFor instance, less technical articles – such as “The Supply\\nof Disinformation Will Soon Be Infinite” (DiResta, 2020)\\n- are often quick to identify the impending ubiquity of\\nsynthetic disinformation. However, they also often avoid\\nexplaining why this outcome is inevitable from a techno-\\nlogical perspective (see Section 2.2 on “the generalization\\nproblem”). Meanwhile, technical analyses often produce\\nvaluable insights on synthetic media but disagree on the\\nthreat level they pose to society. For instance, most tech-\\nnical studies only consider the effects of synthetic media\\non human subjects while overlooking their elusiveness to\\nalgorithmic detection methods (and comparative advantage\\nover manual disinformation) (e.g. Hameleers et al., 2022;\\nLee & Shin, 2022; Iacobucci et al., 2021; Shin & Lee,\\n2022). Those that do manage to address both forms of per-\\nmeability still differ on their definitions of threat, choosing\\nto proxy the harms of synthetic media exposure with “en-\\ngagement intentions” (Lee & Shin, 2022) and Turing tests\\n(Brown et al., 2020), rather than concrete demonstrations\\nof impact. From a more extreme perspective, several arti-\\ncles dismiss the additive threat of “deepfakes” as marginal\\nwithin the larger context of manual “shallow fakes” (Hel-\\nmus, 2022), while others point to more indirect erosions\\nof trust – such as the “liar’s dividend” (Chesney & Citron,\\n2019) - as the real dangers of synthetic media.\\n2.6 The Synthetic Media Development Framework\\nThe many moving pieces of these varied arguments cloud\\na methodical assessment of synthetic media’s impact on\\nsociety – not to mention complicating countermeasure de-\\nvelopment. In response, this study proposes a theoretical\\nframework that separates synthetic media development\\ninto three stages: “production,” “dissemination,” and “con-\\nsumption.” Adopting this framework offers organizational\\nstructure to the complicated topics surrounding synthetic\\nmedia, explains the asymmetrical focus of existing litera-\\nture on political use-cases, and paves a path for addressing\\nthe more targeted research questions this study seeks to\\ninvestigate.\\n2.6.1 The Production Stage\\nThe “production” stage of a synthetic media product, as\\ndefined here, begins with the collection of necessary data\\nto train a deep learning model. Because synthetic media is\\nFigure 5: The “Synthetic Media Development Frame-\\nwork.\"\\ngenerated using machine learning techniques, every sub-\\nphase of the traditional “data science pipeline” is included:\\ndata munging, model generation, testing/hyperparameter\\nadjustment, model selection, etc. (Helmus, 2022; Data\\nScience Pipeline, n.d.). This stage is the most time and\\nresource-intensive stage in the framework, and is consid-\\nered complete when the target synthetic media product\\nhas been generated and is ready for release. In addition to\\nforming the foundation upon which all subsequent frame-\\nwork stages rest, the production stage can have a more\\ndurable effect on the synthetic media production process\\nthrough the introduction of new generative algorithms and\\ntechniques.\\nExamining the production stage in more detail yields im-\\nportant insights about the threat potential of synthetic me-\\ndia products in the future. The first of these is the resiliency\\nof synthetic media products to algorithmic detection, as\\ndiscussed earlier in Chapter 2. However, a second and per-\\nhaps equally important characteristic of synthetic media\\nproduction is how resource-intensive it is. First, a convinc-\\ning synthetic media product requires enough data to train\\nthe underlying model (Hwang, 2020; Helmus, 2022). The\\nsynthetic Tom Cruise video mentioned earlier, for instance,\\nrequired “hours of authentic Tom Cruise footage to train”\\n(Helmus, 2022). Second, training and adjusting a model’s\\nhyperparameters to produce an adequate output can require\\nmonths worth of time. The model underlying the afore-\\nmentioned TikTok video took over two months to train\\n(Helmus, 2022). Indeed, the most recent natural language\\nmodels for producing synthetic text required thousands of\\npetaflop/days to train (Brown et al., 2020; Lohn & Musser,\\n2022). For context, a standard laptop would take several\\nmillennia to accomplish this same task (Lohn & Musser,\\n2022). Finally, this process often involves a monetary cost\\n– either to hire data scientists or professional actors, to pur-\\nchase computing power, or both. Utilizing the Tom Cruise\\nvideo as a point of comparison once more, this product\\n7'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\ncost over $10,000 USD in graphics processing units alone\\n(Helmus, 2022).\\nWhile critics might point to the increased “commodifi-\\ncation” (Hwang, 2020) of these resources through open-\\nsource data, commercial platforms, and improved comput-\\ning efficiency (e.g. quantum computing) in the future, the\\nfact remains that resource requirements currently still iso-\\nlate the production of “tailored” synthetic media (Hwang,\\n2020) to a narrow subsample of probable threat actors and\\nuse-cases. The extensive data requirement for training\\nthese models helps explain why existing synthetic videos\\nare overwhelmingly targeted at celebrities and politicians,\\nwhose faces exist all over the internet via publicly avail-\\nable content. Meanwhile, the resource-intensive nature\\nof synthetic media creation also helps explain why the\\nmajority of advanced, non-pornographic synthetic videos\\nhave emerged in high-reward scenarios, such as political\\npower struggles and high-dollar heists. While a rational,\\nresource-deficient individual or group might shoulder the\\ncost of such an endeavor in pursuit of an urgent objective,\\nit is reasonable to believe that they would think twice be-\\nfore incurring such a high cost – particularly when coupled\\nalongside the risk of criminal attribution (Hwang, 2020).\\nGiven this information, one can reasonably expect syn-\\nthetic media threats in the short term to be carried out by\\nresource-rich organizations or individuals, and oriented\\ntowards data-available targets.\\n2.6.2 The Dissemination Stage\\nThe “dissemination” stage is where content generation al-\\ngorithms first exercise their comparative advantage over\\nmanual media alteration. This stage begins with a syn-\\nthetic product’s release onto any media platform, and ends\\nwhen the product has been seen, read, or heard by a media\\nplatform user. Presumably, the product has successfully\\nbypassed both human and automated efforts to screen it.\\nHowever, this stage can introduce threatening effects to so-\\nciety, even before consumption by individual netizens. The\\nfirst of these is an “erosion of trust in institutions,” (Ches-\\nney & Citron, 2019) introduced by the mere existence\\nof falsified content in the midst of genuine media (Hel-\\nmus, 2022; Kreps et al., 2022). The second is an indirect\\nconsequence of the first and is called the “liar’s dividend”\\n(Chesney & Citron, 2019). This phenomenon describes\\nthe use of synthetic media’s existence as a defense mecha-\\nnism, debunking claims or accusations as “fake” in order\\nto avoid scrutiny (Chesney & Citron, 2019). Finally, this\\nstage interacts circularly with the consumption stage, al-\\nlowing a media product – even with low levels of intrinsic\\ncredibility – to approach “viral” status (Shao et al., 2018).\\nAs consumers engage with the content, it can be reshared\\nand even translated to other users, ultimately migrating\\nacross media platforms (Wakefield, 2022; Allyn, 2022)10\\n10This kind of migration was seen through the release of the Ze-\\nlensky deepfake, in which messages were originally “amplified”\\n(Wakefield, 2022) on Russian social media channel VKontakte\\nbefore spreading to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.\\nand reaching audiences around the globe rapidly. While\\nthis paper deals exclusively with the spread of synthetic\\ncontent, several studies on the spread of disinformation\\nthrough synthetic actors -– such as Twitter “bots” – are\\nworth examining in the context of synthetically-generated\\nmedia (Shao et al., 2018; Caldarelli et al., 2020; V osoughi\\net al., 2018).\\n2.6.3 The Consumption Stage\\nAlthough synthetic media that has passed through the first\\ntwo stages of its development may already have yielded\\nsignificant impacts on society, the “consumption” stage is\\nparticularly important because it demarcates where ideas\\ncontained as digital content transform into human action.\\nThe consumption stage begins when a platform user in-\\nteracts with synthetic media. However, the subsequent\\nactions that succeed initial exposure are less obvious and\\ninfinitely numerous. These include providing online com-\\nmentary on the product, resharing the product with others\\n(back to the dissemination stage), trusting or dismissing its\\ncredibility, and even acting on its content (e.g. organizing a\\nrally, investing, etc.). As seen in the use-cases above, these\\nactions can produce effects ranging from account trans-\\nfers to coups. Finally, the cyclical relationship between\\nthis stage and the dissemination stage facilitates synthetic\\nmedia achieving virality and effects at-scale. Despite the\\ncrucial importance of this stage within the synthetic me-\\ndia development process, machine-to-human influence re-\\nmains remarkably understudied. As a result, it contributes\\nsignificantly to the experimental motivation described in\\nthe following section.\\n3 Experiment\\n3.1 Motive\\n3.1.1 Overlooking Belief, Impact, and Information\\nEnvironments\\nExamining synthetic media through a structured lens –\\nsuch as the synthetic media development framework – pro-\\nvides a new perspective on this subject. First, the techno-\\nlogical “arms race” (Helmus, 2022) between content gen-\\neration and detection, fueled by the generalization problem\\nof algorithmic detection, effectively guarantees the con-\\ntinuous introduction of innovatively manufactured media\\ninto the synthetic media development process’ production\\nstage. Unless impeded by effective countermeasures, these\\nsynthetic products will influence global information en-\\nvironments in potentially harmful ways as they permeate\\nthrough the framework’s stages.\\nThe arrival of these products to the consumption stage\\nyields two significant outcomes. First, it initiates a cycle of\\nconsumption and dissemination that forms the basis of con-\\ntent virality – a core strength of digital media (Iacobucci\\net al., 2021). But perhaps most importantly, it is the stage\\nat which synthetic media crosses from the digital world as\\nan idea, into the physical world as an action – ultimately\\n8'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 6: The relationship between synthetic media, belief,\\nand material impact.\\ntranslating to material impact, such as dollars lost, votes\\ngained, and wars begun. Belief, 11 therefore, might best\\nbe understood as the threshold separating synthetic media\\nconsumption from material impact.\\nYet despite the established psychological importance of\\nbelief on actions (Locke, 1982), as well as its intuitive\\nimportance linking synthetic media and material impact,\\nfew studies have chosen to focus on this axis of synthetic\\nmedia effects. Instead, most research tends to focus on\\nTuring tests, examining the proportion of human subjects\\nor algorithms that correctly distinguish genuine from syn-\\nthetic content (Bray et al., 2022; Korshunov & Marcel,\\n2020; Mai et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020; Iacobucci et al.,\\n2021; Guo et al., 2023). This type of test, while interesting,\\ndoes not necessarily map onto the level of credibility a\\nsubject possesses about the media they are consuming.\\nFurthermore, the few studies that do investigate belief have\\nisolated themselves to the evaluation of political content\\ncredibility (Hameleers et al., 2022; Kreps et al., 2022;\\nLee & Shin, 2022). These studies ignore the many other\\ninformation environments within which information gath-\\nerers might encounter synthetic media, despite initial ev-\\nidence that synthetic textual media may possess influen-\\ntial strength that varies across subject domains – such as\\nmedicine, psychology, and finance (Guo et al., 2023).\\nFor instance, one study involving a prominent text de-\\ntection algorithm called “Grover” (Zellers et al., 2020)\\nreported over 96% classification accuracy for all news cate-\\ngories except one: financial news (Zellers, 2019). Grover’s\\nperformance on synthetic financial news was described\\nas “a notable outlier,” with an accuracy of only 60.5%\\n11As shown in “Defining and Measuring Credibility Of News-\\npapers: Developing an Index,” the term “credibility” logically\\ndecomposes into “belief,” (Locke, 1982; Kreps et al., 2022) de-\\nspite being a “multidimensional concept” (Kreps et al., 2022).\\nThus, these terms are used interchangeably in this study.\\n(Zellers, 2019). However, the reason for this deviation was\\nleft empirically undefined.\\nAnother paper compared the “helpfulness” 有用性rating\\nof ChatGPT Q&A responses to human responses across\\na variety of different subject domains (B. Guo, personal\\ncommunication, 2023). Interestingly, synthetic responses\\nin the finance category were rated at least 8% more help-\\nful than human responses in any other standalone subject.\\nThis trend held true for Q&A comparisons in both Chinese\\nand English (Guo et al., 2023). Furthermore, ChatGPT’s fi-\\nnance responses were the most difficult for “expert respon-\\ndents” (familiar with the ChatGPT platform) to distinguish\\nfrom human responses, when compared side-by-side. This\\ntrend also held true across language comparisons (Guo et\\nal., 2023).\\n3.1.2 The Financial World’s Vulnerability to\\nSynthetic Text\\nThe asymmetrical attention given to political synthetic\\nmedia within preexisting literature aligns with the fact\\nthat synthetic use-cases overwhelmingly involve politi-\\ncal subject matter (as seen in Section 2.3). This trend\\nalso corresponds with the relatively data-rich target pro-\\nfile of political figures, as well as the highly “resource\\nrestrictive” nature of synthetic media production discussed\\nin Section 2.6.1. Indeed, given the intensive time, capi-\\ntal, data, and computing requirements of “tailored” con-\\ntent generation (Helmus, 2022; Hwang, 2020), as well\\nas the risk associated with criminal attribution (Hwang,\\n2020), one should not be surprised to see higher-quality\\n(i.e. non-pornographic) synthetic media levied by and\\nagainst resource-laden government actors. However, this\\ncharacteristic of synthetic content generation also begs\\nanother question: where else should one expect synthetic\\nmedia to emerge?\\nWhile malicious uses of synthetic media within the finan-\\ncial realm are limited to “only a handful of documented\\ncases to date” (Bateman, 2020), several factors make it\\nparticularly vulnerable to synthetic media – especially text\\nmodalities. First, global financial markets are significantly\\ninfluenced by “investor sentiment,” (Baker & Wurgler,\\n2007) which involves “a belief about future cash flows\\nand investment risks” (Baker & Wurgler, 2007). Indeed,\\nmarket sentiment has historically been attributed with mul-\\ntiple noteworthy deviations from rational financial models,\\nto include the stock market crashes of 1929 and 1987, as\\nwell as the “Dot.com” bubble burst in the 1990s (Baker &\\nWurgler, 2007). This characteristic of the financial world\\nis particularly concerning given that textual media inputs,\\nsuch as financial news and social media commentary, are a\\nmajor input to investor sentiment monitoring. Indeed, one\\nof the world’s most “heavily used and highly regarded pro-\\nfessional investment system[s]” (Kenton, 2022) – known as\\nthe “Bloomberg Terminal” – currently incorporates Twitter\\nfeeds within its platform for this very reason (“Bloomberg\\nLaunches a Twitter Feed Optimized for Trading | Press |\\nBloomberg LP,” 2018), and trading algorithms are often\\n9'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nleveraged by fintech companies and high-frequency traders\\n(Bateman, 2020).\\nSecond, the risk tolerance available to actors within the\\nfinancial domain mimics those of the political realm.\\nBoth commonly possess or can access resources sufficient\\nenough to bypass the constraints of the synthetic media\\nproduction stage, including expertise and capital. Addi-\\ntionally, both environments offer high-reward opportunities\\nthat represent a significant return on the intensive resource\\ncosts of synthetic content creation, as well as the criminal\\nattribution risk that might accompany it. While this may\\ntranslate to elections and power positioning in the political\\nworld, hundreds of billions of dollars in market movement\\nmay be at stake in the financial world.\\nFinally, both political and financial information environ-\\nments offer troves of public data available for training\\nsynthetic media algorithms. In the political world, public\\nfigures and debates are often available online, just as finan-\\ncial statements and updates to investors legally required by\\nregulators expose publicly-listed corporations to synthetic\\nmedia targeting (SEC.Gov | Financial Reporting Manual,\\nn.d.; Estevez, 2022; Bateman, 2020).\\nSeveral recent demonstrations of financial disinformation\\nshowcase the vulnerability of financial information envi-\\nronments to synthetic media. One particularly illustrative\\nexample of investor sentiment manipulation seeking up-\\nward market movement occurred in 2021. The “Wallstreet\\nBets\" forum on Reddit, which was created to discuss fi-\\nnancial trades online, made international headlines when a\\ngroup of netizens swayed swaths of investors to drive up\\nthe stock price of used-video-game-company GameStop\\n(Phillips & Lorenz, 2021). Over the course of several\\ndays, GameStop became “the most actively traded stock\\non Wall Street” (Phillips & Lorenz, 2021), raising its\\nmarket value by 1200% to $24 billion USD – all while\\nthe general market declined (Phillips & Lorenz, 2021).\\nWhile this event may appear anecdotal in isolation, in-\\nvestor sentiment fluctuations spurred by the Wallstreet\\nBets forum has repeatedly influenced market movements\\nsince then, including a 280% increase in the share price of\\nsoftware-company Blackberry, and an 840% increase in\\nentertainment-company AMC (Phillips & Lorenz, 2021).\\nA second example of investor sentiment manipulation tar-\\ngeted at downward market movement is the wave of fal-\\nsified social media accounts and messages that overtook\\nTwitter in 2022, mimicking legitimate corporate entities.\\nOne account, impersonating pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly,\\ntweeted that it would begin providing insulin free of charge\\n– one of Eli Lilly’s major products (Harwell, 2022). While\\nthe post was eventually removed by Twitter moderators, Eli\\nLilly’s stock price nonetheless fell by over 4% the follow-\\ning day (Lee, 2022), amounting to “billions” of dollars lost\\nin market value (Harwell, 2022). Meanwhile, other com-\\npanies that fell victim to disinformation posted from fake\\ncorporate accounts included Nintendo, Tesla, and PepsiCo\\n(Mac et al., 2022; Alba, 2022).\\nAs seen above, the introduction of synthetic media to mar-\\nket manipulation efforts is a troubling prospect. As iden-\\ntified in the Carnegie Endowment for Peace’s report on\\n“Deepfakes and Synthetic Media in the Financial System,”\\nattacks could broadly target entire markets (e.g. a “flash\\ncrash”), or narrowly target specific brands (e.g. via “bot-\\nnets”) (Bateman, 2020). However, a “lack of data” on\\nhistorical attacks renders the magnitude of future threats\\nin the financial arena “difficult to judge” (Bateman, 2020).\\n3.2 Hypotheses\\nGiven the aforementioned context, this study sought to\\nmore empirically examine the financial community’s\\nvulnerability to synthetic media through an experiment\\non investor sentiment manipulation. Through the use of a\\nsurvey, data was gathered on how much synthetic financial\\nmedia shifted investor sentiment. Rather than merely\\nasking investors directly, this experiment’s survey also\\ngauged belief through a series of behavioral questions,\\nincluding price change predictions and willingness to\\ninvest. Given the heightened importance of textual data\\ntoward investors and financial institutions, this experiment\\nspecifically focused on synthetic text. The experiment\\nproceeded by examining several hypotheses:\\n• H1: GPT-3.5 produces synthetic financial disin-\\nformation that is more persuasive than genuine\\nfinancial information.\\nTwo factors drove the reasoning behind this hypothesis.\\nFirst, financial reports are more standardized than creative\\nforms of text, given reporting requirements to investors\\n(SEC.Gov | Financial Reporting Manual, n.d.). This might\\nreasonably allow LLMs to more easily modify document\\ncontent without risking document structure. Second, finan-\\ncial text relies heavily on high-context numerical figures,\\nwhich are difficult to observe and easy to manipulate. For\\ninstance, unless an investor were standing directly in a\\nmanufacturing facility, it would be difficult to assess an\\ninventory turnover metric. By comparison, falsified world\\nevents or sports news might be easier for readers to assess\\nfrom afar.\\nOne real-world demonstration of this principle occurred\\nduring Microsoft’s presentation of its OpenAI-powered\\nsearch engine: “Bing AI” (Mehdi, 2023; Warren, 2023).\\nDuring the demo, one of Microsoft’s executives showcased\\nBing AI’s capabilities by generating summarized financial\\nreports. Only after the presentation did online viewers\\nrealize that the search engine had actually offered multiple\\nseverely inaccurate metrics as fact (Warren, 2023). For\\ninstance, Bing AI indicated that clothing-company Gap\\nheld an operating margin of 5.9% in Q3 2022, despite\\nthe fact that this figure did not appear anywhere in Gap’s\\nfinancial statements (Warren, 2023). It also inflated earn-\\nings per share by over 60%, doubled Gap’s cash reserves,\\nand miscalculated inventory by over 30% (Leswing, 2023).\\nUnless a viewer was intimately aware with a company’s\\n10'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nearnings, or the falsification was orders of magnitude re-\\nmoved from a realistic figure, verification of such financial\\nclaims would likely be difficult to assess in real-time.\\nFor clarity, this study’s primary hypothesis did not seek\\nto draw comparisons between synthetically produced fi-\\nnancial media and other forms of synthetically produced\\nmedia – such as the world news article contained in \"All\\nthe News That’s Fit to Fabricate\" (Kreps et al., 2022). How-\\never, this question is thought-provoking and is thus left as\\nan exploratory sub-hypothesis:\\n• H2: GPT-3.5 produces synthetic financial disin-\\nformation that has more persuasive power than\\nsynthetic world news disinformation.\\nLastly, if the assumptions in H1 are true, then it is reason-\\nable to believe that GPT-3.5 might produce more persua-\\nsive financial content for niche industries than non-niche\\nindustries. For example, the average investor might be\\nmore easily misled about semiconductor component man-\\nufacturing than a produce retailer she visits on a weekly\\nbasis. Although this question is not evaluated with statisti-\\ncal rigor due to the time constraints of the study, it is left\\nhere for consideration in future research, and is touched\\nupon when possible:\\n• H3: Synthetic financial disinformation about\\nniche industries is more persuasive than that of\\nnon-niche industries.\\n3.3 Methodology\\nIn order to begin empirically investigating the effects of\\nsynthetic media on global financial communities, this study\\npiloted an exploratory field survey in China. Because many\\nforeign media applications are officially banned in China,\\nthis study leveraged the survey mini-app, Wenjuanxing问\\n卷星, via China’s largest social media application: WeChat\\n微信. Participants were sampled from China’s financial\\nservices community and were each paid 50 RMB (approx-\\nimately $7.30 USD) to randomly complete a survey con-\\ntaining one of three treatment texts. The control group\\nreceived a genuine, Q2 2018 earnings call transcript from\\nbeverage manufacturer The Coca-Cola Company (hence-\\nforth “Coca-Cola”). The second treatment group received a\\nChatGPT-generated Coca-Cola earnings call transcript for\\nthe same fiscal period. Finally, the third treatment group\\nreceived a ChatGPT-generated earnings call transcript of\\nPC manufacturer HP Inc. (henceforth “HP”). This was\\ndone to explore inter-industry differences between syn-\\nthetic financial texts (sub-hypothesis H3).\\nParticipants were informed that the survey was targeted at\\nassessing how different kinds of financial news influence\\nreaders, were instructed not to rely on outside materials\\nfor question-answering, and were asked not to change\\nresponses once they had been completed. Additionally,\\nthe terms “real,” “fake,” and “ChatGPT” were deliberately\\nnot mentioned within the survey in order to avoid biasing\\nparticipants.\\nFigure 7: Gender distribution across treatment groups.\\nFigure 8: Education level distribution across treatment\\ngroups.\\n3.3.1 Participants\\nThe decision to exclusively sample respondents within the\\nfinancial services community was intended to maximize\\nthe likelihood of response completion on topical survey\\ncontent (i.e. financial markets), and to approximate a pop-\\nulation of experienced investors as closely as possible. For\\ncontext, only 7% of Chinese citizens owned stock in 2019\\ncompared to 53% of Americans (Johnston, 2022). The Chi-\\nnese government also regulates investment in companies\\noverseas (Zhou & Leng, 2021). Although this decision\\nscientifically limited the generalizability of this survey’s\\nresults, sampling a financially literate sub-population was\\ndetermined as both cost-efficient (given limited available\\nfunding), and a best alternative for accurately representing\\nglobal investors (given the survey team’s physical location\\nin China). Out of the 165 participants originally surveyed,\\n19 incorrectly answered an attention-check question, yield-\\ning a final sample size of 146 respondents.\\n3.3.2 General Design\\nAll three survey versions possessed the same structure.\\nEach contained two pre-treatment questions, a treatment\\ntext, and 17 post-treatment questions. Treatment texts were\\nalso presented in the same format: an abbreviated company\\n“earnings call” transcript.\\n11'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 9: Financial services experience across treatment\\ngroups.\\nFigure 10: Investment experience across treatment groups.\\n3.3.3 Earnings Call Transcripts\\nFor clarification, earnings calls are press releases con-\\nducted by public companies on a quarterly basis. During\\nthese calls, a company’s top executives share quarterly\\nprogress with investors directly and conclude by hosting a\\nQ&A session with financial analysts about the company’s\\nfuture economic outlook. While executives are expected\\nto report factual information in accordance with the U.S.\\nSecurities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) reporting re-\\nquirements, earnings calls often “cast the previous quarter\\nin the best light possible” (Estevez, 2022). Analysts track\\nthese calls closely to gauge whether a given company’s\\nquarterly expectations were met. Consequently, “there is\\nusually a direct and immediate response to [a company’s]\\nstock price” following an earnings call’s conclusion (Es-\\ntevez, 2022).\\nThe control treatment in this study utilized a publicly-\\navailable transcription of Coca-Cola’s Q2 2018 earnings\\ncall via The Motley Fool’s website (Coca-Cola Company\\n(The) (KO) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript,\\n2018).\\nSeveral design decisions are worth explaining in more de-\\ntail. For instance, four factors drove the decision to use\\nan earnings call transcript from 2018. First, prompting\\nChatGPT for content after 2021 resulted in errors, due to\\nthe model’s training data “cutoff” (Why doesn’t ChatGPT\\nknow about X? | OpenAI Help Center, n.d.). Therefore,\\nin order to restrict variation between control and experi-\\nmental treatments, genuine earnings call transcripts had\\nto be sampled prior to 2021. Second, the use of a 2018\\nearnings call facilitated the possibility of results compari-\\nson against earlier language models (trained on pre-2019\\ndata) in future research studies. Third, utilizing a non-\\nrecent earnings call intuitively reduced the possibility that\\nrespondents were able to rely on memory to recall com-\\npany performance, better isolating treatment effects on\\nrespondent behavior. Finally, using a pre-2019 earnings\\ncall removed confounding associations with COVID-19’s\\ninfluence on equity markets. In the spirit of this consid-\\neration, a second quarter earnings call was also chosen to\\navoid the possibility of volatile investor sentiment at the\\nbeginning and end of the 2018 fiscal year.\\nThe use of Coca-Cola and HP as treatment companies was\\ndeliberate as well. Choosing multinational corporations\\nwith a brand presence in China seemed to mitigate the\\ngeneral lack of Chinese investment activity in international\\nsecurities. Thus, company names were randomly sampled\\nfrom “The S&P Global 100 Index” – a list including the\\ntop multinational enterprises in the world (S&P Global\\n100, n.d.; S&P Global 100 Constituents, n.d.). Coca-Cola\\nand HP both exist within this global ranking. From there,\\ncandidate companies were manually culled using several\\ncriteria. First, the candidate in question had to have a\\n2018 Q2 or Q3 earnings call transcript posted on The\\nMotley Fool’s website. Second, the candidate had to have\\na presence in China’s domestic market, in order to cater\\nto respondents’ visibility and awareness of the company.\\nAs of 2013, Coca-Cola owned 16% of China’s beverage\\nmarket share (Coca-Cola Says to Invest over $4 Billion in\\nChina in 2015-2017 | Reuters, 2013), and as of 2023, HP\\nhas operated in China for 40 years (Ma, 2023). Finally,\\nthe transcript had to be free of transcription errors by The\\nMotley Fool, such as the indication of “inaudible” phrases,\\nin order to focus survey responses on transcript content\\nrather than syntax errors.\\nFor both genuine and fake earnings call transcripts used\\nin this study, only the first 550 Chinese characters (after\\ntranslation) were considered usable, with a buffer of 50\\ncharacters granted to prevent unnatural, mid-paragraph\\ncutoffs in the treatment text. This standardization was\\nchosen because the free version of ChatGPT limits out-\\nput to about 500 words, as well as to avoid excessively\\nbiasing survey respondents towards text length. Earnings\\ncall cruft – such as call operator comments, call handovers,\\netc. – was also removed in accordance with the method-\\nological notion of “upper-bound credibility” adopted from\\nthe study, “All the News That’s Fit to Fabricate” (Kreps\\net al., 2022). “Upper-bound credibility” conditions rea-\\nsonably assume that disinformation campaign actors will\\n“cherry pick” autonomously generated content that maxi-\\nmizes the likelihood it will fool its audience (Kreps et al.,\\n2022). Overall, seven words were excluded from the begin-\\nning of the genuine Coca-Cola transcript (“James Quincy:\\nThanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone.” 詹姆斯昆西: 谢\\n12'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\n谢, Tim. 大家早上好), and an incompatible translation for\\n“mid-single-digit\" was converted to “4%-6%.\"12 For the\\nsynthetic Coca-Cola transcript, one awkward phrase was\\nremoved (“...和某些市场单位箱体积下降.”), and two\\nawkward character-phrases were adjusted (在changed to\\n可以, and 福利changed to 生活方式), based on translator\\nrecommendations. CEOs typically speak first during earn-\\nings calls, so all three abbreviated treatment texts exclu-\\nsively contained CEO commentary. Ultimately, treatment\\ntexts were 547 words long, on average.13\\n3.3.4 Survey Questions\\nEmulating \"All the News That’s Fit to Fabricate,\" survey\\nrespondents were explicitly asked to rate the “credibil-\\nity\" (Q5) of a given treatment text (Kreps et al., 2022).\\nHowever, several behavioral survey questions were also\\nincluded to more comprehensively measure the influence\\nof synthetic financial text on investors. These included\\nshort-term economic outlook of the treatment company\\nbefore and after treatment (PQ1, Q3),14 prediction in share\\nprice change (Q1), and willingness to invest (Q2).\\nBecause treatment groups contained approximately 50 ob-\\nservations each, a “student t-distribution\" was used to com-\\npare sample statistics. Statistical significance for survey\\nresponses was thus determined using independent, two-\\nsample t-tests.15 Additionally, Welch’s t-tests were used to\\naccount for unequal variance across groups.\\nAlthough data was gathered on an HP treatment text to\\nbegin exploring sub-hypothesis H3, the primary focus of\\nthis study was to gauge differences between the control\\nand treatment Coca-Cola texts. Therefore, statistical anal-\\nysis was constrained to these two treatment groups (with\\nexception to inter-synthetic treatment comparisons). The\\nnull hypotheses for each of the research questions posed in\\nthis study amount to the absence of meaningful difference\\nin persuasive power between control and treatment texts.\\n12As discussed in later sections, metrics may have played an\\nimportant role in influencing survey respondents. However, un-\\nder these assumptions, this alteration to the control treatment\\ntext should have weakened the experiment’s results, if anything.\\nTherefore, it is ignored in the discussion of experimental “Limi-\\ntations.\"\\n13The number of Chinese characters is not perfectly equivalent\\nto word count (given that some Chinese phrases consist of two\\nor more characters). However, it serves as rough approximation,\\nand was thus treated as equivalent.\\n14“Q3,\" here, stands for “Question 3,\" and should not be con-\\nfused with similar abbreviations for fiscal quarters. “PQ1\" stands\\nfor “Pre-Treatment Question 1.\"\\n15Although “Change in Short-Term Economic Outlook\" score\\nwas calculated within treatment samples, treatment groups were\\ntreated as independent samples. Therefore, the difference in\\nmeans between treatment scores was also calculated using an\\nindependent, two-sample t-test.\\n3.3.5 Procedure\\nIn order to cater to Chinese respondents, survey questions\\nfor each survey version were translated from English into\\nChinese via ChatGPT and human editing (OpenAI, 2022).\\nHowever, in order to avoid introducing bias between gen-\\nuine and synthetic text, treatment texts were translated\\nvia different methods. The genuine earnings call tran-\\nscript chosen for this study was translated from English\\ninto simplified Chinese via two human translators – both\\npossessing background knowledge in finance.\\nSynthetic transcripts, on the other hand, were generated\\nvia the March 14, 2023, version of ChatGPT (OpenAI,\\n2022). Due to ChatGPT’s inability to consistently generate\\nChinese text directly, as well as OpenAI’s disproportionate\\nuse of English-language data to train its language models\\n(Brown et al., 2020), synthetic treatment texts were initially\\ngenerated in English before translation back into Chinese\\n– all via ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022). 16 The quality of the\\nsynthetic Coca-Cola transcript was also secondarily vetted\\nby translators, in order to ensure conditions of upper-bound\\ncredibility were upheld.\\nCoca-Cola’s synthetic transcript was generated via the fol-\\nlowing prompt: “Generate the first 550 words of a fictional\\nQ2 2018 earnings call transcript for The Coca-Cola Com-\\npany with a negative economic outlook.” HP’s synthetic\\ntranscript was generated by simply replacing “The Coca-\\nCola Company” with “HP Inc.,\" as well as an explicit\\ninstruction to “restrict output to comments by the CEO\"\\nto match the Coca-Cola output format. The prompt modi-\\nfier “with a negative economic outlook” was deliberately\\nchosen to juxtapose the tendency of genuine earnings calls\\nto frame company economic outlooks in “the best light\\npossible” (Estevez, 2022). This enabled a clearer examina-\\ntion of changes in respondent perception of their treatment\\ncompany before and after treatment. Translations into sim-\\nplified Chinese were generated by instructing ChatGPT\\nto “Translate the following into Chinese:”, followed by\\npasting the full, synthetic transcript in its English version.\\n4 Results\\n4.1 Change in Short-Term Economic Outlook (PQ1,\\nQ3)\\nIn order to account for biases, survey participants were\\nasked two pre-treatment questions about how they per-\\nceived the short-term (PQ1) and long-term (PQ2) eco-\\nnomic outlooks of their treatment company. Response\\noptions mimicked the four-option Likert scale utilized in\\n“All the News That’s Fit to Fabricate” (Kreps et al., 2022):\\n“Very unfavorable” 非常不利, \"Somewhat unfavorable”\\n16When asked to generate Chinese text directly, ChatGPT\\nhaphazardly produced an automatic error about being an “English\\nlanguage model” (OpenAI, 2022). Therefore, ChatGPT was first\\nprompted to generate synthetic treatment texts in English before\\ntranslating them into Chinese.\\n13'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nFigure 11: Old short-term economic outlook (PQ1).\\nFigure 12: New short-term economic outlook (Q3).\\n有点不利, \"Somewhat favorable 有点有利, and “Very\\nfavorable” 非常有利.\\nFollowing treatment, participants were asked to assess the\\nshort-term economic outlook of the treatment company\\nagain. Participants in the control group considered Coca-\\nCola’s new economic outlook to be “somewhat favorable”\\non average (mean: 3.163, SD: ± 0.681), while partici-\\npants in the synthetic Coca-Cola group (mean: 2.260, SD:\\n± 0.626) generally held less favorable views following\\ntreatment.\\nThe average difference in (raw) outlook scores after treat-\\nment amounted to over a half a step down the Likert scale\\n(difference in means: -0.542, p-value: 0.000***), indicat-\\ning that exposure to a (negative) synthetic earnings call\\nsignificantly damaged participants’ perspective of Coca-\\nCola’s financial outlook in the near-term, compared to the\\ncontrol group. Of course, this might be expected given the\\nnegative prompt modifier provided to ChatGPT prior to\\nsynthetic transcript generation.\\nIn order to evaluate the influential power of synthetic treat-\\nment independently of positive or negative valence, two\\nadditional tests were undertaken on the data. First, a t-test\\nwas taken using the absolute value of change in outlook\\nscores across treatment groups. Second, an equivalent t-\\ntest was taken, but on a binary “conversion” variable. This\\nlatter method was inspired by the methodology in “All the\\nTable 1: Outlook Difference Between Treatments\\n(Raw Score)\\nTreatment Mean Diff. in Means p-value\\nControl 0.082 – –\\nSynthetic -0.460 -0.542 0.000***\\na *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nTable 2: Outlook Difference Between Treatments\\n(Binary Score)\\nTreatment Mean Diff. in Means p-value\\nControl 0.184 – –\\nSynthetic 0.360 0.176 0.049*\\na *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nNews That’s Fit to Fabricate,” in which four-option Likert\\nscale responses were condensed into two binary categories\\n(Kreps et al., 2022). 17 In this case, “Very unfavorable”\\nand “Somewhat unfavorable” responses where grouped to-\\ngether in a singular “Unfavorable” category, while “Some-\\nwhat favorable” and “Very favorable” were coded as “Fa-\\nvorable” responses. A respondent’s change from one cat-\\negory to another category after treatment yielded a score\\nof 1, while no change corresponded to a score of 0. This\\nengineered “conversion\" feature selectively rewarded ex-\\ntreme changes in perspective, rather than incremental shifts.\\nConveniently, this numerical mean also corresponded to\\nthe percentage of responses within each treatment group,\\nimproving interpretability.\\nWhile the first method did not show differences across\\ntreatments, the binary conversion metric yielded a 17.6%\\nincrease in (average) outlook conversions across treatments\\n(difference in means: 0.176, p-value: 0.049*). These re-\\nsults were robust against correlation with long-term eco-\\nnomic outlook, and lend support to the primary hypothe-\\nsis (H1) that ChatGPT-generated financial texts may have\\ngreater influence over investors than genuine financial texts\\ndo. Of course, these findings are currently constrained to a\\nsample of Chinese investors, the use of GPT-3.5, and earn-\\nings call text involving The Coca-Cola Company. However,\\nthe possibility that synthetic text holds powerful sway over\\ninvestors carries sobering implications for the global finan-\\ncial community.\\n4.2 Share Price Change Prediction (Q1)\\nThe first post-treatment question asked survey participants\\nhow they anticipated treatment company share price to\\nchange (Q1), “based on [their] impression” of the treatment\\ntext.

The partici-\\npants were then asked to choose among five options: either\\nkeep the $1000 USD, or use portions of the gifted money\\nto invest in the treatment company’s stock, broken down\\nalong $250 USD increments (keeping the remainder as\\ncash).\\nThe synthetic treatment group (mean: 3.120, SD: ± 1.107)\\ndemonstrated diminished willingness to invest in their treat-\\nment company than the control group did, on average\\nFigure 14: Investment willingness between treatments\\n(Q2).\\nTable 4: Investment Willingness Between Treat-\\nments (Raw Score)\\nTreatment Mean Diff. in Means p-value\\nControl 3.673 – –\\nSynthetic 3.120 -0.553 0.010*\\na *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\n(mean: 3.673, SD: ± 0.977).

Examining the relationship between pre and\\npost-treatment variables indicates a potential confound-\\ning factor: long-term economic bias. Indeed, long-term\\neconomic outlook had three times more positive of a cor-\\nrelative effect on investment willingness towards HP (0.34)\\nthan towards Coca-Cola (0.10).\\nA less favorable long-term outlook coupled by a lower\\ninvestment willingness towards HP may reveal a “funda-\\nmentalist” investment approach within the sampling group\\n– an investment philosophy which espouses a preference\\nfor holding long-term investments based on the durable\\nvalue of a company rather than trading based on short-\\nterm changes in stock price (Zucchi, 2021). Given that HP\\nInc. is a technology company, it is possible that these re-\\nsults represent the caution of experienced investors towards\\nhigher volatility technology stocks. Confirming this rela-\\ntionship merits further research and a more robust sample\\nsize of investors.\\n4.4 Credibility Assessment of Treatment Text (Q5)\\nLeveraging a four-option Likert scale similar to the one\\nfound in “All the News That’s Fit to Fabricate\" (Kreps\\net al., 2022), the fifth post-treatment question asked sur-\\nvey participants to directly rate the treatment text as either\\n“Completely unbelievable\" 完全不可信, “Somewhat un-\\nbelievable” 不太可信, “Somewhat believable” 有些可\\n信, and “Very believable” 非常可信. Although Kreps et\\nal.’s study does acknowledge the possible dissection of\\ncredibility into multiple dimensions, it also confirms the\\nlogical decomposition of “credibility” into “believability”\\n(Kreps et al., 2022). In order to simplify analysis, this\\nstudy asked participants to directly assess credibility as a\\nstandalone characteristic. Dividing the Likert scale into an\\neven number of response options had the additional benefit\\nof encouraging survey respondents onto either side of the\\nresponse spectrum, rather than allowing them to occupy a\\nneutral middle ground.\\nTwo different methods were used for aggregating the re-\\nsults of this question. The first method merely examined\\nthe difference in raw credibility scores of the control group\\n(mean: 3.265, SD: ± 0.442) and the synthetic treatment\\ngroup (mean: 3.220, SD: ± 0.502). However, the results\\ndid not statistically support rejection of the null hypothesis\\nthat genuine and synthetic earnings call transcripts share\\ncomparable degrees of credibility.\\nFigure 15: Credibility assessment of treatment text (Q5).\\nTable 7: Credibility Assessments Between Treat-\\nments (Binary Score)\\nTreatment Mean Diff. in Means p-value\\nControl 1.000 – –\\nSynthetic 0.960 -0.040 0.159\\na *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\nThe second method used the same binary aggregation used\\nfor Q3 (and originally proposed by Kreps et al.), bifur-\\ncating the Likert responses into two categories (“Unbe-\\nlievable” and “Believable”), and recording the average\\nnumber of “Believable” responses. Once again, this nu-\\nmerical mean conveniently corresponded to the percentage\\nof responses within each treatment group. The control\\ngroup evaluated 100% of treatment texts as credible under\\nthis binary threshold (mean: 1.000, SD: ± 0.000), while\\nthe synthetic treatment group evaluated 96% of texts as\\ncredible (mean: 0.960, SD: ± 0.196). In other words, gen-\\nuine and synthetic texts were virtually indistinguishable\\nto survey participants through the lens of credibility, and\\nrejection of the null hypothesis was once again statistically\\ninfeasible.\\nIn order to begin exploring alternate hypothesis H2, the dif-\\nference in means for Kreps et al.’s best-performing model\\n(against a genuine world news article) was compared\\nagainst the difference in means for this study’s synthetic\\nexperiment group (against a genuine Coca-Cola transcript).\\nConducting a t-test on this “difference in difference-in-\\nmeans\" did not yield statistically significant results, though\\nthe markedly smaller deltas between this study (-0.040)\\nand Kreps et al.’s study (0.130) suggests that the credibility\\ngap between synthetic and genuine content may be nar-\\nrowing. This gap reduction may be due to several factors,\\nincluding the improvement of GPT-3.5 over GPT-2, the\\ndifference in text subject matter, or other miscellaneous\\nreasons. However, conclusively isolating a cause lay be-\\nyond the scope of this experiment.\\n16'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 16}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nTable 8: Credibility Assessments Between Text Type (Bi-\\nnary Score)\\nControl Treatment\\nStudy % “Credible\" % “Credible\" Diff.\\nKreps 0.71 0.84 0.13\\nKeeley 1.00 0.96 -0.04\\na *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.\\n4.5 Limitations\\nAs in most studies, this experiment suffers from several\\nlimitations. First, critics might identify the difference in\\n“economic outlook\" polarity between genuine and synthetic\\nearnings call treatment texts as problematic. Because gen-\\nuine earnings calls are usually framed in a “positive light\"\\n(Estevez, 2022), and ChatGPT was instructed to generate\\ncalls with a “negative economic outlook,” the shift in in-\\nvestor sentiment witnessed in this study might – in the eyes\\nof critics – lack profundity.\\nIn response, it first bears reiterating that these synthetic\\ntexts were generated autonomously and with minimal man-\\nual edits. In this context, the ability of a language model\\nto produce convincing results (in less than 15 seconds)\\nthat effectively reverse the perceptions of experienced in-\\nvestors is impressive on its own. Nonetheless, two separate\\nmetrics were taken to more equitably assess influential\\npower independent of positive or negative valence: the\\nabsolute value of short-term outlook score changes, and a\\nbinary outlook change metric. As seen in Section 4.1, these\\nvalence-agnostic metrics provided importance nuance to\\nthe raw scores of Q3.\\nFurthermore, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis was con-\\nducted on all three texts to assess how textual sentiment\\nadjustment by GPT-3.5 may have influenced investor senti-\\nment.18 The pre-trained “SnowyNLP\" (Wang, 2013/2023)\\nand “V ADER” (Hutto & Gilbert, 2014) sentiment models\\nwere used for the Chinese and English versions of each\\nsurvey, respectively. Although the genuine Coca-Cola text\\ndid yield a slightly more positive compound sentiment\\nscore than the synthetic Coca-Cola text, the difference in\\nsentiment scores was surprisingly small at 2.5% for the\\nChinese version and 0.4% for the English version (4.4%\\nand 14.8% for HP). Thus, attributing change in investor\\nsentiment based on text sentiment polarity alone seems\\nfar-fetched. Nonetheless, future studies seeking to provide\\na more balanced assessment of influential power would\\n18For clarification, two different kinds of “sentiments” are dis-\\ncussed here. Investor sentiment refers to belief about the future\\noutlook of particular financial securities, which was the depen-\\ndent variable this study sought to measure. Meanwhile, text\\nsentiment refers to the calculation of a document’s tone by ag-\\ngregating “positive” and “negative” words within the document.\\nThis analysis was carried out for the Coca-Cola control and treat-\\nment texts to more closely examine how ChatGPT manipulated\\ntext to influence investor belief.\\nbenefit by providing valence-equivalent control and treat-\\nment texts side-by-side for survey respondents. This would\\nfurther isolate the influential effects of synthetic financial\\ntext against genuine financial text.\\nA second limitation of this study is its limited generaliz-\\nability to other types of financial news, different investor\\naudiences, alternative language models, and other publicly-\\nlisted companies. Earnings calls, for instance, might not\\nbe the main information source for some investors – par-\\nticularly outside of China. Global investors might also\\ncarry different biases and preexisting knowledge about\\nequity markets across international boundaries. Because\\nthe “average” investor comprises a majority of what we\\nknow as “the market,” examining the impact of synthetic\\nmedia on investors without financial services backgrounds\\nwould be a valuable future research direction. Addition-\\nally, the use of GPT-3.5 was primarily driven by its rising\\npopularity and public availability at the time of this writ-\\ning. The comparison of influential power between different\\nlanguage models, particularly given the recent incorpora-\\ntion of GPT-4 into ChatGPT’s API (OpenAI, 2023), merits\\nexamination in future research, too. Lastly, this experi-\\nment was only able to control for and draw statistically\\nconclusive results for financial text about The Coca-Cola\\nCompany. Although this study utilized a synthetic HP earn-\\nings call for exploratory comparison, any data involving\\nHP – other than perhaps comparisons between synthetic\\ntreatment results – should be treated purely as exploratory.\\nFuture studies should absolutely analyze treatments from\\ndifferent industries to explore inter-industry differences\\nmore rigorously.\\nThird, critics might point out that survey respondents don’t\\nhave reason to doubt the credibility of a document provided\\nin a survey. In other words, a certain amount of trust is em-\\nbedded within the relationship between survey providers\\nand survey respondents, helping explain the overwhelm-\\ning confidence in text credibility across treatments. While\\nthis might be true, the decision to blind participants to\\nthe possibility of viewing misleading or synthetic text was\\ndeliberately taken for two important reasons. First, as seen\\nvia the Eli-Lilly Tweet episode described earlier, historical\\nfinancial text manipulation (albeit non-synthetic) has often\\ncome under the guise of prominent enterprises. Therefore,\\nreplicating a “real world\" synthetic threat should not be\\nany different. Second, previous studies (as mentioned in\\nChapter 2) suggest that human subjects perform no better\\nthan random guessing when they are instructed to classify\\nsynthetic versus genuine texts. In fact, one study even sug-\\ngested that some survey participants were unresponsive to\\nsynthetic-text disclaimers (Kreps et al., 2022). Therefore,\\nwarning survey participants about potential exposure to\\nsynthetic or falsified texts might have led to skewed or\\ndiluted results.\\nFourth, this experiment may have understated the ability\\nof GPT-3.5 to persuade investors by virtue of its prompt.\\nThe prompt utilized in this experiment did not explicitly in-\\nstruct ChatGPT to “persuade.” Given preliminary research\\n17'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nabout the potency of “prompt engineering” (Crothers et al.,\\n2023), the absence of an instruction to persuade makes this\\nstudy’s results all the more compelling.\\nFinally, this study was carried out using simplified Chinese\\ntext, and GPT-3.5 is a language model primarily trained\\non English data. As seen in Guo et al.’s results, differences\\nin human detection rates of synthetic media exist between\\nChinese and English text outputs (Guo et al., 2023). Given\\nuniformly higher detection rates for synthetic financial\\ntexts produced in Chinese (Guo et al., 2023), this study ex-\\npected to see declines in investor outlook changes and cred-\\nibility assessments of synthetic treatment text in Chinese.\\nThus, replication of this study using English surveys and\\nEnglish-native participants would likely only strengthen\\nthe results found here.\\n5 Conclusion\\n5.1 Overview\\nTo recap, this study sought to fill several gaps within the\\nfield of synthetic media literature. First, it highlighted the\\nnovelty of synthetic media threats versus traditional media\\nthreats in the face of growing public misunderstanding.\\nSecond, it showcased an asymmetrical focus within exist-\\ning literature on audio-visual media, the impacts of syn-\\nthetic media on political information environments, and\\nTuring tests – particularly when juxtaposed against the\\npopular emergence of another synthetic media modality:\\ntext.\\nThird, it identified impact potential and resource limita-\\ntions by organizing the synthetic media development pro-\\ncess into a theoretical framework, pointing to financial\\ninformation environments as prime candidates for future\\nsynthetic media disruption via text modalities.\\nFinally, in the preceding chapter, it empirically tested the\\ninfluential power of synthetic financial texts on investors\\ncompared to genuine financial texts. Rather than merely\\nassessing the ability of survey participants to distinguish\\ngenuine from synthetic text, this study sought to go a step\\nfurther; to measure the impact of synthetic media by ob-\\nserving its ability to manipulate belief : the keystone link-\\ning information to action. Ultimately, these actions are\\nresponsible for the outcomes we fear as a society – whether\\nthey involve election tampering, or financial manipulation.\\nIn this context, the results from this study’s experiment\\nare concerning. As expected, the credibility ratings for\\ngenuine and synthetic texts were indistinguishably high –\\neven for financial experts. Comparing these results against\\nthose in Kreps et al.’s study also suggests that the gap\\nseparating synthetic outputs and genuine media may be\\nnarrowing as generative models improve.\\nMore interestingly, however, falsified texts primed with a\\nnegative financial outlook significantly shifted investment\\nbehavior away from what it otherwise might have been\\nunder truthful information conditions. This behavior was\\nevidenced across multiple variables related to stock market\\nengagement, including share price predictions and will-\\ningness to invest. Alone, these drastic shifts in investor\\nsentiment already paint a frightening picture for the finan-\\ncial world.\\nHowever, examination of valence-agnostic metrics that\\nignored the positive and negative directionality of score\\nchanges revealed an even bleaker one. While comparing\\nabsolute value means between treatments lacked conclu-\\nsive results, a statistically significant difference did exist\\nfor a binary “conversion” variable. One interpretation that\\nreconciles these results is that genuine and synthetic texts\\ntend to equivalently influence marginal improvements or\\ndegradations of an investor’s outlook on a company. For\\nexample, an investor that originally viewed Coca-Cola’s\\nshort-term economic outlook as “Somewhat favorable”\\nmight change her outlook to “Very favorable” after reading\\na positively-primed, genuine earnings call transcript. How-\\never, synthetic earnings calls demonstrated a unique ability\\nto influence extreme changes in outlook about a company –\\nconverting investors from holding a positive outlook all the\\nway across the spectrum to a negative outlook, and vice\\nversa. In other words, synthetic financial media produced\\nby ChatGPT may be better at changing minds than the truth\\nis. This unique trend should inspire concern within the\\nglobal financial community, particularly given the histor-\\nical vulnerability of equity markets to investor sentiment\\nshocks.\\nOf course, the next steps forward involve understanding\\nwhy this trend exists in order to determine what might be\\ndone about it. As mentioned in the “Limitations” section,\\nsentiment analysis of the Chinese and English versions of\\neach treatment text yielded disappointingly similar scores,\\ndiscounting the probability that hyperbolic language within\\nthe synthetic treatment texts swayed survey respondents.\\nInstead, reviewing survey participant write-in responses\\nyielded more interesting insights into the ability of syn-\\nthetic media to change investor sentiment.\\n5.2 Potential Explanations\\n5.2.1 Write-In Response Analysis for Change in\\nEconomic Outlook (Q3)\\nPost-treatment questions four and six asked survey par-\\nticipants to briefly explain their choices about adjusted\\nshort-term economic outlook (Q3) and credibility assess-\\nments (Q5), respectively. Responses to question four fell in\\nseveral different categories; some participants latched on\\nto key phrases, such as “worker strikes”罢工, while others\\ncited external economic factors and long-term company\\noutlook. On the whole, however, investors overwhelm-\\ningly cited \"metrics” as a key driver of adjusted short-term\\noutlook – across all treatments. Specific metrics cited\\nincluded “revenue” 收入, “operating profit” 营业利润,\\nand “growth” 增长. For investors that changed their minds\\nabout Coca-Cola’s short-term outlook, approximately 2 out\\nof 3 cited data within the treatment text as a primary rea-\\n18'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nson.19 This estimate is also likely conservative, given that\\nseveral investors within the “No change” category focused\\non profit declines in their written responses, but refused\\nto update their pre-treatment score for their post-treatment\\nresponse.\\n5.2.2 Write-In Response Analysis for Credibility\\nAssessments (Q5)\\nResponses to question six provided even more context.\\nOne of the leading themes for high-credibility scores re-\\nvolved around the use of “data” 数据– but particularly in\\nan “objective” 客观fashion. Although many participants\\nshowcased a belief that “the data says everything” 数据说\\n明一切, the balance of negative and positive self-critique\\nby CEOs in the synthetic and genuine texts seemed to espe-\\ncially convince survey participants of the text’s authenticity.\\nIn the words of one participant, “Who would splash dirty\\nwater on themselves?” 谁会往自己身上泼脏水? By con-\\ntrast, the few texts that did receive low credibility scores\\nwere often cited as being “exaggerated” 夸张or incorrect.\\nEvaluating the treatment text’s metric accuracy against\\nCoca-Cola’s actual earnings release in Q2 2018 validated\\nthe survey respondents’ focus on balanced metrics. As\\nseen in Appendix C, ChatGPT’s output presented some fig-\\nures accurately (e.g. “net revenue of $8.9 billion”), but still\\nmanaged to spin some of them within a negative context\\n(Q2 2018 Earnings Release, 2018). In the synthetic Coca-\\nCola transcript, many of the negative modifiers were also\\ninaccurate. For instance, the transcript reported that “op-\\nerating income declined by 5%” while the actual earnings\\nrelease suggested an increase of 34% (Q2 2018 Earnings\\nRelease, 2018). Interestingly, some negative modifiers\\nwere also incorrectly conservative. For instance, the “2%\\nyear-over-year\" revenue decline reported by ChatGPT was\\nactually a decline of 8% (Q2 2018 Earnings Release, 2018).\\nWhether the balance in these inconsistencies was random\\nor deliberate is unclear and left to future research.\\nA final, more concerning theme for credibility assessments\\ncentered on source trustworthiness. Dozens of respondents\\ncited the CEO’s direct commentary, Coca-Cola’s brand\\nreputation, and/or the company’s public listing on equity\\nmarkets as reasons for believing the content within the\\ntext. For example, one participant was quoted as saying,\\n“This was published by The Coca-Cola Company’s CEO,\\nthe company is prestigious, and it is a large brand, so [the\\ntext] is trustworthy” 因为这个是可口可乐公司CEO发\\n布的公告,可口可乐在国际上还是比较享有信誉的,也\\n是大品牌,所以信得过. Another respondent remarked, “A\\ncompany can’t really release fake news” 一个公司不太\\n可能发布假消息. While these responses might partially\\nreflect China’s more controlled information environments,\\nthe responses also correspond with research that links per-\\nceptions of information authenticity with source trustwor-\\nthiness (Hinkis & Turner, 2022).\\n19Entries that specifically mentioned “data,” “metrics,” finan-\\ncial figures (e.g. “4%\"), or accounting terminology (e.g. “operat-\\ning profit”) were tallied as “metric\" citations.\\n5.3 A Path Forward: Countermeasures\\nUnfortunately, the identification of metrics as a key influ-\\nential variable across all treatments leaves the connection\\nbetween synthetic financial text and outlook conversions\\na mystery. However, the responsiveness of survey partici-\\npants to balanced metrics and source authenticity serves\\nas an excellent starting point for future research – as well\\nas for deliberating ways to mitigate the harmful effects of\\nsynthetic media. Currently, discussion of countermeasures\\nwithin preexisting literature can be divided into several ar-\\neas (Helmus, 2022; Hwang, 2020). Three overarching cat-\\negories are considered in the following section: detection\\nmethods, media literacy campaigns, and policymaking.\\n5.3.1 Detection\\nDetection methods typically involve the use of machine\\nlearning or deep learning algorithms to identify synthetic\\nmaterial. From the perspective of the synthetic media de-\\nvelopment framework, these methods can be levied within\\nthe dissemination or consumption stages. Both private\\ncompanies (e.g. Meta) and public organizations (e.g. The\\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency) have made\\nconcerted efforts to develop these kinds of solutions (Hel-\\nmus, 2022; Hwang, 2020) – and across multiple modali-\\nties. For example, several common algorithms for identi-\\nfying synthetic text include Grover, RoBERTa, and GLTR\\n(Crothers et al., 2023; Pu et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2023).\\nThese models use frequency features, fluency features, and\\nother types of variables for classifying genuine text against\\nsynthetic text (Crothers et al., 2023). Unfortunately, as dis-\\ncussed earlier, these efforts have tended to fall victim to the\\nsame generalization problem encountered during Meta’s\\nDFDC (Helmus, 2022). Indeed, one recent study on text\\ndetection found that “open-domain detection schemes fail\\nto generalize to in-the-wild [sic] synthetic text, and that\\nmost defenses are not robust under adversarial settings”\\n(Pu et al., 2022).\\nAnother approach that falls within the detection counter-\\nmeasure category involves the manipulation of data to pre-\\nvent its malign use. Several names exist for the outcomes\\nof this process, to include “radioactive” (Helmus, 2022;\\nHwang, 2020) or “watermarked” data (A Watermark for\\nLLMs - a Hugging Face Space by Tomg-Group-Umd, n.d.).\\nRegardless of name, the premise remains the same: embed\\nslight alterations (undetectable to the human eye) within\\npublic data likely to be used for training generative algo-\\nrithms. This provides preemptive clues about malicious\\nsynthetic content generation (Helmus, 2022). Flagging\\nsynthetic content prior to consumption has also been em-\\npirically linked to limiting the spread of synthetic media\\n(Helmus, 2022; Iacobucci et al., 2021). However, separate\\nstudies point to workarounds that algorithm developers\\ncan use to easily bypass these safeguards (Sadasivan et al.,\\n2023). While privately safeguarding detection algorithms\\nas national security products might benefit government\\nstakeholders temporarily (Helmus, 2022), the general pub-\\nlic would likely still suffer.\\n19'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nIn practice, it is possible that opensource detection meth-\\nods will always run into the generalization problem. For\\nthis reason, private and institutional investors might con-\\nsider disconnecting from high-volume, sentiment-sensitive\\ninformation inputs like Twitter. Alternatively, if the fi-\\nnancial services world insists on continuously developing\\ndetection algorithms, these products would benefit by iden-\\ntifying volatile changes in consumer sentiment, focusing\\non source authenticity, and flagging metric inaccuracies.\\nOne product that appears to be moving in the right direc-\\ntion is the DeepTrust algorithm, proposed by Pok Wah\\nChan in 2022. DeepTrust combines both machine learn-\\ning and natural language processing to classify anomalous\\nmarket changes due to suspicious Tweets (Chan, 2022).\\n5.3.2 Media Literacy Campaigns\\nMedia literacy campaigns are efforts to educate people –\\nin this case, private and institutional investors – about the\\nthreats that synthetic media pose. From the perspective of\\nthe synthetic media development framework, this method\\nis primarily targeted at breaking the self-perpetuating,\\nconsumption-dissemination cycle. Several independent\\norganizations currently undertake this initiative via edu-\\ncational materials, seminars, blogs, etc., including WIT-\\nNESS (WITNESS Media Lab | Prepare, Don’t Panic: Syn-\\nthetic Media and Deepfakes - WITNESS Media Lab, n.d.)\\nand the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab\\n(“About the Atlantic Council,” n.d.).\\nHowever, these organizations face a challenging paradox;\\nalthough several studies prove that synthetic media aware-\\nness reduces both the likelihood of consumers to believe it\\n(Shin & Lee, 2022) and spread it (Iacobucci et al., 2021;\\nShin & Lee, 2022), increased awareness also inflates peo-\\nples’ (mistaken) belief in their ability to detect it (Cochran\\n& Napshin, 2021). Implementing this balancing act in the\\nglobal financial community might amount to cautioning\\nprivate investors on social media investment forums, selec-\\ntively publishing warnings through investment regulators\\nsuch as the SEC, and adjusting new-hire training curricula\\nto prevent the disruption of corporate investments. Cur-\\nrently, the SEC publishes a list of fraudulent companies on\\nits website (SEC.Gov | Public Alert: Unregistered Solicit-\\ning Entities (PAUSE), n.d.), as well as investor training to\\navoid stock “pump and dump” schemes (Pump and Dump\\nSchemes | Investor.Gov, n.d.). These resources do address\\ninvestor vulnerability to source-trustworthiness biases, but\\nmight additionally benefit by including descriptions of\\nsynthetic threat technology, periodic updates on targeted\\nindustries, and warnings about threat actor approaches (e.g.\\nmetric balancing).\\n5.3.3 Policy\\nGiven the relatively nascent emergence of synthetic me-\\ndia, and the speed with which it is evolving, policymakers\\nhave only recently begun formulating solutions for miti-\\ngating its harmful effects. However, policymaking does\\narguably represent the most flexible category of counter-\\nmeasure, capable of targeting any stage of the synthetic\\nmedia development process.\\nFor example, China has clearly focused on the produc-\\ntion stage of synthetic media development, addressing the\\nproblem at its root. In November of 2022, the Cyberspace\\nAdministration of China (CAC) released its “Regulations\\non the management of the in-depth synthesis of Internet in-\\nformation services” (Cyberspace Administration of China\\n中华人民共和国国家互联网信息办公室, 2022). Ac-\\ncording to this policy, the burden of responsibility for\\ndissemination and consumption of synthetic media ma-\\nterial falls entirely on the shoulders of “synthetic content\\nproviders” 深度合成服务提供者– to include manag-\\ning data privacy, criminal reporting, safety audits, content\\nmanagement, and even rumor dispersion (Cyberspace Ad-\\nministration of China 中华人民共和国国家互联网信息\\n办公室, 2022; China Law Translate, 2022). Following\\nthe production of several models mirroring ChatGPT in\\nChina, the CAC drafted a follow-on regulation on “gener-\\native artificial intelligence” that appears to impose more\\nspecific guidance, including preemptive government secu-\\nrity reviews and data management guidelines (Cyberspace\\nAdministration of China中华人民共和国国家互联网信\\n息办公室, 2023; Coldewey, 2023)\\nBy contrast, the European Union’s (EU) “Digital Services\\nAct” has focused more on the dissemination stage of the\\nsynthetic media development framework. The Act, which\\nwas released in October of 2022, stipulates that social me-\\ndia platforms must empower users to file complaints, im-\\nplement mechanisms for resolving grievances, and assign\\nrepresentative liaisons to EU member states (EUR-Lex -\\n32022R2065 - EN - EUR-Lex, 2022).\\nFinally, the United States has predominantly targeted the\\nconsumption-dissemination cycle within the synthetic me-\\ndia development process – primarily evidenced by its pro-\\nposal of the “DEEP FAKES Accountability Act” in 2019\\n(116th Congress (2019-2020), 2019). This bill specifically\\ncriminalizes failure to adhere to “watermarking” standards\\nfor synthetically-generated content, assigning a maximum\\nsentence of up to five years in prison (116th Congress\\n(2019-2020), 2019).\\nThe decision regarding which stage to target will likely\\nrevolve around value prioritization and existing technology\\nframeworks, which can differ greatly from country to coun-\\ntry. For instance, China’s policy measure likely centers on\\nsynthetic content providers rather than individual criminals\\nand foreign threats because it can afford to from a regu-\\nlatory standpoint. Unlike many other countries, China’s\\n\"Great Firewall” is carefully monitored and insulated from\\nforeign influence (Roberts, 2018). Meanwhile, the United\\nStates continuously struggles to balance the threat poten-\\ntial of synthetic disinformation against freedom of speech\\nprotections – even for “false speech” (Baek, 2020). Both\\nnations likely face sacrificing innovative and benevolent\\nsynthetic media development in exchange for mitigating\\nits negative effects. Ultimately, the varied approaches\\nemployed by policymakers around the world reaffirm the\\n20'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/cash_credibility.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='A PREPRINT - JUNE 9, 2023\\nglobal reach of synthetic media influence, as well as the\\ncareful tradeoffs that must be made to control it.\\n5.4 Final Reflections\\nPrior to November of 2022, the topic of synthetic media\\ninfluence was largely buried within academic journals and\\nconstrained to isolated conversations about national secu-\\nrity. The release of ChatGPT likely changed that forever.\\nSince then, novel uses and adaptations of its underlying\\ntechnology have been developed rapidly. For instance,\\nwithin four months of ChatGPT’s inauguration (and fol-\\nlowing implementation of this experiment’s survey), Ope-\\nnAI announced the release of GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). The\\nannouncement included claims of improved performance\\nacross multiple benchmarks, and has led to the adoption of\\nGPT-4 by multiple organizations – including financial ser-\\nvices giant Morgan Stanley (OpenAI, 2023). Additionally,\\nglobal research teams of all sizes have begun scrambling\\nto build language models that emulate ChatGPT’s success.\\nFor instance, a team from Fudan University in Shanghai\\nannounced the “MOSS” model in February of 2023, while\\nChinese technology giant Baidu released “Ernie Bot” in\\nMarch (Yang, 2023). Finally, models that specialize in\\nspecific domains of day-to-day life have begun emerging\\nas well. One such model, called “BloombergGPT,” was\\nspecifically designed to excel in financial matters, claiming\\nimproved performance across multiple tasks such as named\\nentity recognition and sentiment analysis (Wu et al., 2023).\\nAlthough studies suggest that increasingly large language\\nmodels will experience diminishing marginal returns at\\ninfluencing variables like “credibility” (Kreps et al., 2022),\\nit will be interesting to see whether such models deter or\\namplify market vulnerability alongside a synthetic media\\ninflux.\\nOn a final note, this study’s use of Chinese survey partici-\\npants to evaluate the deployment of an American language\\nmodel was admittedly a product of happenstance. How-\\never, it also serves as an apt reminder (much like the Great\\nRecession of 2008) that the financial community is a global\\none; the fates of its stakeholders – especially China and\\nthe United States – are closely interwoven. Safeguarding\\nthe security of financial information environments cannot\\nbe the sole burden of any one entity, and may very well\\nserve as a proving ground for international cooperation in\\nthe future.\\nReferences\\n[noa, a] About the Atlantic Council.\\n[noa, b] Data Science Pipeline.\\n[noa, c] New GPT-3 capabilities: Edit & insert.\\n[noa, d] Pump and Dump Schemes | Investor.gov.\\n[noa, e] SEC.gov | Financial Reporting Manual.\\n[noa, f] SEC.gov | Public Alert: Unregistered Soliciting\\nEntities (PAUSE).\\n[noa, g] S&P Global 100.\\n[noa, h] S&P Global 100 Constituents.\\n[noa, i] A Watermark for LLMs - a Hugging Face Space\\nby tomg-group-umd.\\n[noa, j] Why doesn’t ChatGPT know about X? | OpenAI\\nHelp Center.\\n[noa, k] WITNESS Media Lab | Prepare, Don’t Panic:\\nSynthetic Media and Deepfakes - WITNESS Media\\nLab.\\n[noa, 2008] (2008).

The global beverage\\nindustry is growing faster than last year, driven by better results in the emerging and developing markets, and also the\\nsparkling soft drink category. We’re gaining value share as we execute on the strategies we laid out for you in early\\n2017, and importantly, our operating performance is accelerating as a result.\\nSo, 2018 – at the halfway mark of the year, we’re seeing good momentum in our underlying business. Organic revenue\\nis up 5% year to date, driven by a good mixture of volume and price mix, global volume is up 3%, which is the strongest\\nwe’ve seen in five years, and comparable EPS is up 5% year to date despite stronger currency headwinds than we\\nanticipated at the beginning of 2018, and, as we noted at the start of the year, we’ve always expected EPS growth to be\\nback-half weighted, and that has not changed.\\nSo, operationally, looking around the world, we delivered strong top-line growth in the first half of the year, driven by\\ncontinued strength in our international markets. In Asia-Pacific, strong performance in key emerging markets like\\nChina, India, and Vietnam drove mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for this segment during the first half of the\\nyear. While we continue to expand our total beverage portfolio across all of our Asia markets, our sparkling soft drink\\nportfolio led our top-line acceleration.\\nTurning to Latin America, even in the face of headwinds, we delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth\\nfor the first half as we focused on the fundamentals.

While typically task-agnostic\\nin architecture, this method still requires task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of\\nthousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only\\na few examples or from simple instructions – something which current NLP systems still largely\\nstruggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic,\\nfew-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art ﬁne-\\ntuning approaches. Speciﬁcally, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion\\nparameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in\\nthe few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or ﬁne-tuning,\\nwith tasks and few-shot demonstrations speciﬁed purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3\\nachieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and\\ncloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-ﬂy reasoning or domain adaptation, such as\\nunscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same\\ntime, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3’s few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some\\ndatasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally,\\nwe ﬁnd that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difﬁculty\\ndistinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this ﬁnding\\nand of GPT-3 in general.\\n∗Equal contribution\\n†Johns Hopkins University, OpenAI\\nAuthor contributions listed at end of paper.\\narXiv:2005.14165v4  [cs.CL]  22 Jul 2020'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Contents\\n1 Introduction 3\\n2 Approach 6\\n2.1 Model and Architectures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\\n2.2 Training Dataset . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8\\n2.3 Training Process . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 9\\n2.4 Evaluation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10\\n3 Results 10\\n3.1 Language Modeling, Cloze, and Completion Tasks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11\\n3.2 Closed Book Question Answering . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13\\n3.3 Translation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14\\n3.4 Winograd-Style Tasks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16\\n3.5 Common Sense Reasoning . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17\\n3.6 Reading Comprehension . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\\n3.7 SuperGLUE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18\\n3.8 NLI . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20\\n3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 21\\n4 Measuring and Preventing Memorization Of Benchmarks 29\\n5 Limitations 33\\n6 Broader Impacts 34\\n6.1 Misuse of Language Models . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 35\\n6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 36\\n6.3 Energy Usage . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 39\\n7 Related Work 39\\n8 Conclusion 40\\nA Details of Common Crawl Filtering 43\\nB Details of Model Training 43\\nC Details of Test Set Contamination Studies 43\\nD Total Compute Used to Train Language Models 46\\nE Human Quality Assessment of Synthetic News Articles 46\\nF Additional Samples from GPT-3 48\\nG Details of Task Phrasing and Speciﬁcations 50\\nH Results on All Tasks for All Model Sizes 63\\n2'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecent years have featured a trend towards pre-trained language representations in NLP systems, applied in increasingly\\nﬂexible and task-agnostic ways for downstream transfer. First, single-layer representations were learned using word\\nvectors [MCCD13, PSM14] and fed to task-speciﬁc architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of representations\\nand contextual state were used to form stronger representations [DL15, MBXS17, PNZtY18] (though still applied to\\ntask-speciﬁc architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer language models [VSP+17] have\\nbeen directly ﬁne-tuned, entirely removing the need for task-speciﬁc architectures [RNSS18, DCLT18, HR18].\\nThis last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging NLP tasks such as reading comprehension,\\nquestion answering, textual entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new architectures\\nand algorithms [RSR+19, LOG+19, YDY+19, LCG+19]. However, a major limitation to this approach is that while\\nthe architecture is task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-speciﬁc datasets and task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning: to achieve\\nstrong performance on a desired task typically requires ﬁne-tuning on a dataset of thousands to hundreds of thousands\\nof examples speciﬁc to that task. Removing this limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.\\nFirst, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of labeled examples for every new task limits the\\napplicability of language models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language tasks, encompassing\\nanything from correcting grammar, to generating examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many\\nof these tasks it is difﬁcult to collect a large supervised training dataset, especially when the process must be repeated\\nfor every new task.\\nSecond, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data fundamentally grows with the expressiveness\\nof the model and the narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for the pre-training plus\\nﬁne-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then\\nﬁne-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [ HLW+20] observe that larger models do not necessarily\\ngeneralize better out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the generalization achieved under this paradigm\\ncan be poor because the model is overly speciﬁc to the training distribution and does not generalize well outside it\\n[YdC+19, MPL19]. Thus, the performance of ﬁne-tuned models on speciﬁc benchmarks, even when it is nominally at\\nhuman-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task [GSL+18, NK19].\\nThird, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most language tasks – a brief directive in natural\\nlanguage (e.g. “please tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad”) or at most a tiny number\\nof demonstrations (e.g. “here are two examples of people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery”) is often\\nFigure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised pre-training, a language model develops a broad\\nset of skills and pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize\\nthe desired task. We use the term “in-context learning” to describe the inner loop of this process, which occurs within\\nthe forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a\\nmodel would see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded\\nwithin a single sequence.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='Figure 1.2: Larger models make increasingly efﬁcient use of in-context information. We show in-context learning\\nperformance on a simple task requiring the model to remove random symbols from a word, both with and without a\\nnatural language task description (see Sec. 3.9.2). The steeper “in-context learning curves” for large models demonstrate\\nimproved ability to learn a task from contextual information. We see qualitatively similar behavior across a wide range\\nof tasks.\\nsufﬁcient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a reasonable degree of competence. Aside from pointing\\nto a conceptual limitation in our current NLP techniques, this adaptability has practical advantages – it allows humans\\nto seamlessly mix together or switch between many tasks and skills, for example performing addition during a lengthy\\ndialogue. To be broadly useful, we would someday like our NLP systems to have this same ﬂuidity and generality.\\nOne potential route towards addressing these issues is meta-learning1 – which in the context of language models means\\nthe model develops a broad set of skills and pattern recognition abilities at training time, and then uses those abilities\\nat inference time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task (illustrated in Figure 1.1). Recent work [RWC+19]\\nattempts to do this via what we call “in-context learning”, using the text input of a pretrained language model as a form\\nof task speciﬁcation: the model is conditioned on a natural language instruction and/or a few demonstrations of the task\\nand is then expected to complete further instances of the task simply by predicting what comes next.\\nWhile it has shown some initial promise, this approach still achieves results far inferior to ﬁne-tuning – for example\\n[RWC+19] achieves only 4% on Natural Questions, and even its 55 F1 CoQa result is now more than 35 points behind\\nthe state of the art. Meta-learning clearly requires substantial improvement in order to be viable as a practical method of\\nsolving language tasks.\\nAnother recent trend in language modeling may offer a way forward. In recent years the capacity of transformer\\nlanguage models has increased substantially, from 100 million parameters [ RNSS18], to 300 million parameters\\n[DCLT18], to 1.5 billion parameters [RWC+19], to 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19],\\nand ﬁnally 17 billion parameters [Tur20]. Each increase has brought improvements in text synthesis and/or downstream\\nNLP tasks, and there is evidence suggesting that log loss, which correlates well with many downstream tasks, follows a\\nsmooth trend of improvement with scale [KMH+20]. Since in-context learning involves absorbing many skills and\\ntasks within the parameters of the model, it is plausible that in-context learning abilities might show similarly strong\\ngains with scale.\\n1In the context of language models this has sometimes been called “zero-shot transfer”, but this term is potentially ambiguous:\\nthe method is “zero-shot” in the sense that no gradient updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time\\ndemonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero examples. To avoid this confusion, we use the term “meta-learning”\\nto capture the inner-loop / outer-loop structure of the general method, and the term “in context-learning” to refer to the inner\\nloop of meta-learning. We further specialize the description to “zero-shot”, “one-shot”, or “few-shot” depending on how many\\ndemonstrations are provided at inference time. These terms are intended to remain agnostic on the question of whether the model\\nlearns new tasks from scratch at inference time or simply recognizes patterns seen during training – this is an important issue which\\nwe discuss later in the paper, but “meta-learning” is intended to encompass both possibilities, and simply describes the inner-outer\\nloop structure.\\n4'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Figure 1.3: Aggregate performance for all 42 accuracy-denominated benchmarks While zero-shot performance\\nimproves steadily with model size, few-shot performance increases more rapidly, demonstrating that larger models are\\nmore proﬁcient at in-context learning. See Figure 3.8 for a more detailed analysis on SuperGLUE, a standard NLP\\nbenchmark suite.\\nIn this paper, we test this hypothesis by training a 175 billion parameter autoregressive language model, which we call\\nGPT-3, and measuring its in-context learning abilities. Speciﬁcally, we evaluate GPT-3 on over two dozen NLP datasets,\\nas well as several novel tasks designed to test rapid adaptation to tasks unlikely to be directly contained in the training\\nset. For each task, we evaluate GPT-3 under 3 conditions: (a) “few-shot learning”, or in-context learning where we\\nallow as many demonstrations as will ﬁt into the model’s context window (typically 10 to 100), (b) “one-shot learning”,\\nwhere we allow only one demonstration, and (c) “zero-shot” learning, where no demonstrations are allowed and only\\nan instruction in natural language is given to the model. GPT-3 could also in principle be evaluated in the traditional\\nﬁne-tuning setting, but we leave this to future work.\\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the conditions we study, and shows few-shot learning of a simple task requiring the model to\\nremove extraneous symbols from a word. Model performance improves with the addition of a natural language task\\ndescription, and with the number of examples in the model’s context,K. Few-shot learning also improves dramatically\\nwith model size. Though the results in this case are particularly striking, the general trends with both model size and\\nnumber of examples in-context hold for most tasks we study. We emphasize that these “learning” curves involve no\\ngradient updates or ﬁne-tuning, just increasing numbers of demonstrations given as conditioning.\\nBroadly, on NLP tasks GPT-3 achieves promising results in the zero-shot and one-shot settings, and in the the few-shot\\nsetting is sometimes competitive with or even occasionally surpasses state-of-the-art (despite state-of-the-art being held\\nby ﬁne-tuned models). For example, GPT-3 achieves 81.5 F1 on CoQA in the zero-shot setting, 84.0 F1 on CoQA in\\nthe one-shot setting, 85.0 F1 in the few-shot setting. Similarly, GPT-3 achieves 64.3% accuracy on TriviaQA in the\\nzero-shot setting, 68.0% in the one-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting, the last of which is state-of-the-art\\nrelative to ﬁne-tuned models operating in the same closed-book setting.\\nGPT-3 also displays one-shot and few-shot proﬁciency at tasks designed to test rapid adaption or on-the-ﬂy reasoning,\\nwhich include unscrambling words, performing arithmetic, and using novel words in a sentence after seeing them\\ndeﬁned only once. We also show that in the few-shot setting, GPT-3 can generate synthetic news articles which human\\nevaluators have difﬁculty distinguishing from human-generated articles.\\nAt the same time, we also ﬁnd some tasks on which few-shot performance struggles, even at the scale of GPT-3. This\\nincludes natural language inference tasks like the ANLI dataset, and some reading comprehension datasets like RACE\\nor QuAC. By presenting a broad characterization of GPT-3’s strengths and weaknesses, including these limitations, we\\nhope to stimulate study of few-shot learning in language models and draw attention to where progress is most needed.\\nA heuristic sense of the overall results can be seen in Figure 1.3, which aggregates the various tasks (though it should\\nnot be seen as a rigorous or meaningful benchmark in itself).\\n5'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='We also undertake a systematic study of “data contamination” – a growing problem when training high capacity models\\non datasets such as Common Crawl, which can potentially include content from test datasets simply because such\\ncontent often exists on the web. In this paper we develop systematic tools to measure data contamination and quantify\\nits distorting effects. Although we ﬁnd that data contamination has a minimal effect on GPT-3’s performance on most\\ndatasets, we do identify a few datasets where it could be inﬂating results, and we either do not report results on these\\ndatasets or we note them with an asterisk, depending on the severity.\\nIn addition to all the above, we also train a series of smaller models (ranging from 125 million parameters to 13 billion\\nparameters) in order to compare their performance to GPT-3 in the zero, one and few-shot settings. Broadly, for most\\ntasks we ﬁnd relatively smooth scaling with model capacity in all three settings; one notable pattern is that the gap\\nbetween zero-, one-, and few-shot performance often grows with model capacity, perhaps suggesting that larger models\\nare more proﬁcient meta-learners.\\nFinally, given the broad spectrum of capabilities displayed by GPT-3, we discuss concerns about bias, fairness, and\\nbroader societal impacts, and attempt a preliminary analysis of GPT-3’s characteristics in this regard.\\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows.

Section 3 presents results on the full range of tasks in the zero-, one- and few-shot settings.\\nSection 4 addresses questions of data contamination (train-test overlap). Section 5 discusses limitations of GPT-3.\\nSection 6 discusses broader impacts. Section 7 reviews related work and Section 8 concludes.\\n2 Approach\\nOur basic pre-training approach, including model, data, and training, is similar to the process described in [RWC+19],\\nwith relatively straightforward scaling up of the model size, dataset size and diversity, and length of training. Our use\\nof in-context learning is also similar to [RWC+19], but in this work we systematically explore different settings for\\nlearning within the context. Therefore, we start this section by explicitly deﬁning and contrasting the different settings\\nthat we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a\\nspectrum of how much task-speciﬁc data they tend to rely on. Speciﬁcally, we can identify at least four points on this\\nspectrum (see Figure 2.1 for an illustration):\\n• Fine-Tuning (FT) has been the most common approach in recent years, and involves updating the weights of\\na pre-trained model by training on a supervised dataset speciﬁc to the desired task. Typically thousands to\\nhundreds of thousands of labeled examples are used. The main advantage of ﬁne-tuning is strong performance\\non many benchmarks. The main disadvantages are the need for a new large dataset for every task, the potential\\nfor poor generalization out-of-distribution [ MPL19], and the potential to exploit spurious features of the\\ntraining data [GSL+18, NK19], potentially resulting in an unfair comparison with human performance. In\\nthis work we do not ﬁne-tune GPT-3 because our focus is on task-agnostic performance, but GPT-3 can be\\nﬁne-tuned in principle and this is a promising direction for future work.\\n• Few-Shot (FS) is the term we will use in this work to refer to the setting where the model is given a few\\ndemonstrations of the task at inference time as conditioning [RWC+19], but no weight updates are allowed.\\nAs shown in Figure 2.1, for a typical dataset an example has a context and a desired completion (for example\\nan English sentence and the French translation), and few-shot works by giving K examples of context and\\ncompletion, and then one ﬁnal example of context, with the model expected to provide the completion. We\\ntypically set Kin the range of 10 to 100 as this is how many examples can ﬁt in the model’s context window\\n(nctx = 2048). The main advantages of few-shot are a major reduction in the need for task-speciﬁc data and\\nreduced potential to learn an overly narrow distribution from a large but narrow ﬁne-tuning dataset. The main\\ndisadvantage is that results from this method have so far been much worse than state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned\\nmodels. Also, a small amount of task speciﬁc data is still required. As indicated by the name, few-shot\\nlearning as described here for language models is related to few-shot learning as used in other contexts in\\nML [HYC01, VBL+16] – both involve learning based on a broad distribution of tasks (in this case implicit in\\nthe pre-training data) and then rapidly adapting to a new task.\\n• One-Shot (1S) is the same as few-shot except that only one demonstration is allowed, in addition to a natural\\nlanguage description of the task, as shown in Figure 1. The reason to distinguish one-shot from few-shot and\\nzero-shot (below) is that it most closely matches the way in which some tasks are communicated to humans.\\nFor example, when asking humans to generate a dataset on a human worker service (for example Mechanical\\nTurk), it is common to give one demonstration of the task. By contrast it is sometimes difﬁcult to communicate\\nthe content or format of a task if no examples are given.\\n6'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='Figure 2.1: Zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, contrasted with traditional ﬁne-tuning . The panels above show\\nfour methods for performing a task with a language model – ﬁne-tuning is the traditional method, whereas zero-, one-,\\nand few-shot, which we study in this work, require the model to perform the task with only forward passes at test\\ntime. We typically present the model with a few dozen examples in the few shot setting. Exact phrasings for all task\\ndescriptions, examples and prompts can be found in Appendix G.\\n• Zero-Shot (0S) is the same as one-shot except that no demonstrations are allowed, and the model is only given\\na natural language instruction describing the task. This method provides maximum convenience, potential for\\nrobustness, and avoidance of spurious correlations (unless they occur very broadly across the large corpus of\\npre-training data), but is also the most challenging setting. In some cases it may even be difﬁcult for humans\\nto understand the format of the task without prior examples, so this setting is in some cases “unfairly hard”.\\nFor example, if someone is asked to “make a table of world records for the 200m dash”, this request can be\\nambiguous, as it may not be clear exactly what format the table should have or what should be included (and\\neven with careful clariﬁcation, understanding precisely what is desired can be difﬁcult). Nevertheless, for at\\nleast some settings zero-shot is closest to how humans perform tasks – for example, in the translation example\\nin Figure 2.1, a human would likely know what to do from just the text instruction.\\nFigure 2.1 shows the four methods using the example of translating English to French. In this paper we focus on\\nzero-shot, one-shot and few-shot, with the aim of comparing them not as competing alternatives, but as different\\nproblem settings which offer a varying trade-off between performance on speciﬁc benchmarks and sample efﬁciency.\\nWe especially highlight the few-shot results as many of them are only slightly behind state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models.\\nUltimately, however, one-shot, or even sometimes zero-shot, seem like the fairest comparisons to human performance,\\nand are important targets for future work.\\nSections 2.1-2.3 below give details on our models, training data, and training process respectively. Section 2.4 discusses\\nthe details of how we do few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations.\\n7'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='Model Name nparams nlayers dmodel nheads dhead Batch Size Learning Rate\\nGPT-3 Small 125M 12 768 12 64 0.5M 6.0 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 Medium 350M 24 1024 16 64 0.5M 3.0 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 Large 760M 24 1536 16 96 0.5M 2.5 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 XL 1.3B 24 2048 24 128 1M 2.0 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 2.7B 2.7B 32 2560 32 80 1M 1.6 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 6.7B 6.7B 32 4096 32 128 2M 1.2 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 13B 13.0B 40 5140 40 128 2M 1.0 ×10−4\\nGPT-3 175B or “GPT-3” 175.0B 96 12288 96 128 3.2M 0.6 ×10−4\\nTable 2.1: Sizes, architectures, and learning hyper-parameters (batch size in tokens and learning rate) of the models\\nwhich we trained. All models were trained for a total of 300 billion tokens.\\n2.1 Model and Architectures\\nWe use the same model and architecture as GPT-2 [RWC+19], including the modiﬁed initialization, pre-normalization,\\nand reversible tokenization described therein, with the exception that we use alternating dense and locally banded sparse\\nattention patterns in the layers of the transformer, similar to the Sparse Transformer [CGRS19]. To study the dependence\\nof ML performance on model size, we train 8 different sizes of model, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 125\\nmillion parameters to 175 billion parameters, with the last being the model we call GPT-3. Previous work [KMH+20]\\nsuggests that with enough training data, scaling of validation loss should be approximately a smooth power law as a\\nfunction of size; training models of many different sizes allows us to test this hypothesis both for validation loss and for\\ndownstream language tasks.\\nTable 2.1 shows the sizes and architectures of our 8 models. Here nparams is the total number of trainable parameters,\\nnlayers is the total number of layers, dmodel is the number of units in each bottleneck layer (we always have the\\nfeedforward layer four times the size of the bottleneck layer, dﬀ = 4∗dmodel), and dhead is the dimension of each\\nattention head. All models use a context window of nctx = 2048tokens. We partition the model across GPUs along\\nboth the depth and width dimension in order to minimize data-transfer between nodes. The precise architectural\\nparameters for each model are chosen based on computational efﬁciency and load-balancing in the layout of models\\nacross GPU’s. Previous work [KMH+20] suggests that validation loss is not strongly sensitive to these parameters\\nwithin a reasonably broad range.\\n2.2 Training Dataset\\nDatasets for language models have rapidly expanded, culminating in the Common Crawl dataset2 [RSR+19] constituting\\nnearly a trillion words. This size of dataset is sufﬁcient to train our largest models without ever updating on the same\\nsequence twice. However, we have found that unﬁltered or lightly ﬁltered versions of Common Crawl tend to have\\nlower quality than more curated datasets. Therefore, we took 3 steps to improve the average quality of our datasets:\\n(1) we downloaded and ﬁltered a version of CommonCrawl based on similarity to a range of high-quality reference\\ncorpora, (2) we performed fuzzy deduplication at the document level, within and across datasets, to prevent redundancy\\nand preserve the integrity of our held-out validation set as an accurate measure of overﬁtting, and (3) we also added\\nknown high-quality reference corpora to the training mix to augment CommonCrawl and increase its diversity.\\nDetails of the ﬁrst two points (processing of Common Crawl) are described in Appendix A. For the third, we added\\nseveral curated high-quality datasets, including an expanded version of the WebText dataset [ RWC+19], collected\\nby scraping links over a longer period of time, and ﬁrst described in [ KMH+20], two internet-based books corpora\\n(Books1 and Books2) and English-language Wikipedia.\\nTable 2.2 shows the ﬁnal mixture of datasets that we used in training. The CommonCrawl data was downloaded from\\n41 shards of monthly CommonCrawl covering 2016 to 2019, constituting 45TB of compressed plaintext before ﬁltering\\nand 570GB after ﬁltering, roughly equivalent to 400 billion byte-pair-encoded tokens. Note that during training, datasets\\nare not sampled in proportion to their size, but rather datasets we view as higher-quality are sampled more frequently,\\nsuch that CommonCrawl and Books2 datasets are sampled less than once during training, but the other datasets are\\nsampled 2-3 times. This essentially accepts a small amount of overﬁtting in exchange for higher quality training data.\\n2https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/\\n8'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='Figure 2.2: Total compute used during training. Based on the analysis in Scaling Laws For Neural Language Models\\n[KMH+20] we train much larger models on many fewer tokens than is typical. As a consequence, although GPT-3 3B\\nis almost 10x larger than RoBERTa-Large (355M params), both models took roughly 50 petaﬂop/s-days of compute\\nduring pre-training.

As a\\nresult, when we train for 300 billion tokens, some datasets are seen up to 3.4 times during training while other datasets\\nare seen less than once.\\nA major methodological concern with language models pretrained on a broad swath of internet data, particularly large\\nmodels with the capacity to memorize vast amounts of content, is potential contamination of downstream tasks by\\nhaving their test or development sets inadvertently seen during pre-training. To reduce such contamination, we searched\\nfor and attempted to remove any overlaps with the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper.\\nUnfortunately, a bug in the ﬁltering caused us to ignore some overlaps, and due to the cost of training it was not feasible\\nto retrain the model. In Section 4 we characterize the impact of the remaining overlaps, and in future work we will\\nmore aggressively remove data contamination.\\n2.3 Training Process\\nAs found in [KMH+20, MKAT18], larger models can typically use a larger batch size, but require a smaller learning\\nrate. We measure the gradient noise scale during training and use it to guide our choice of batch size [MKAT18]. Table\\n2.1 shows the parameter settings we used. To train the larger models without running out of memory, we use a mixture\\nof model parallelism within each matrix multiply and model parallelism across the layers of the network. All models\\nwere trained on V100 GPU’s on part of a high-bandwidth cluster provided by Microsoft. Details of the training process\\nand hyperparameter settings are described in Appendix B.\\n9'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 9}, page_content='2.4 Evaluation\\nFor few-shot learning, we evaluate each example in the evaluation set by randomly drawing K examples from that\\ntask’s training set as conditioning, delimited by 1 or 2 newlines depending on the task. For LAMBADA and Storycloze\\nthere is no supervised training set available so we draw conditioning examples from the development set and evaluate\\non the test set. For Winograd (the original, not SuperGLUE version) there is only one dataset, so we draw conditioning\\nexamples directly from it.\\nK can be any value from 0 to the maximum amount allowed by the model’s context window, which isnctx = 2048\\nfor all models and typically ﬁts 10 to 100 examples. Larger values of Kare usually but not always better, so when a\\nseparate development and test set are available, we experiment with a few values of Kon the development set and then\\nrun the best value on the test set. For some tasks (see Appendix G) we also use a natural language prompt in addition to\\n(or for K = 0, instead of) demonstrations.\\nOn tasks that involve choosing one correct completion from several options (multiple choice), we provide Kexamples\\nof context plus correct completion, followed by one example of context only, and compare the LM likelihood of\\neach completion. For most tasks we compare the per-token likelihood (to normalize for length), however on a small\\nnumber of datasets (ARC, OpenBookQA, and RACE) we gain additional beneﬁt as measured on the development set\\nby normalizing by the unconditional probability of each completion, by computing P(completion|context)\\nP(completion|answer context), where\\nanswer context is the string \"Answer: \" or \"A: \" and is used to prompt that the completion should be an answer\\nbut is otherwise generic.\\nOn tasks that involve binary classiﬁcation, we give the options more semantically meaningful names (e.g. “True” or\\n“False” rather than 0 or 1) and then treat the task like multiple choice; we also sometimes frame the task similar to what\\nis done by [RSR+19] (see Appendix G) for details.\\nOn tasks with free-form completion, we use beam search with the same parameters as [RSR+19]: a beam width of 4\\nand a length penalty of α= 0.6. We score the model using F1 similarity score, BLEU, or exact match, depending on\\nwhat is standard for the dataset at hand.\\nFinal results are reported on the test set when publicly available, for each model size and learning setting (zero-, one-,\\nand few-shot). When the test set is private, our model is often too large to ﬁt on the test server, so we report results on\\nthe development set. We do submit to the test server on a small number of datasets (SuperGLUE, TriviaQA, PiQa)\\nwhere we were able to make submission work, and we submit only the 200B few-shot results, and report development\\nset results for everything else.\\n3 Results\\nIn Figure 3.1 we display training curves for the 8 models described in Section 2. For this graph we also include 6\\nadditional extra-small models with as few as 100,000 parameters. As observed in [ KMH+20], language modeling\\nperformance follows a power-law when making efﬁcient use of training compute. After extending this trend by two\\nmore orders of magnitude, we observe only a slight (if any) departure from the power-law. One might worry that these\\nimprovements in cross-entropy loss come only from modeling spurious details of our training corpus. However, we will\\nsee in the following sections that improvements in cross-entropy loss lead to consistent performance gains across a\\nbroad spectrum of natural language tasks.\\nBelow, we evaluate the 8 models described in Section 2 (the 175 billion parameter parameter GPT-3 and 7 smaller\\nmodels) on a wide range of datasets. We group the datasets into 9 categories representing roughly similar tasks.\\nIn Section 3.1 we evaluate on traditional language modeling tasks and tasks that are similar to language modeling,\\nsuch as Cloze tasks and sentence/paragraph completion tasks. In Section 3.2 we evaluate on “closed book” question\\nanswering tasks: tasks which require using the information stored in the model’s parameters to answer general\\nknowledge questions. In Section 3.3 we evaluate the model’s ability to translate between languages (especially one-shot\\nand few-shot). In Section 3.4 we evaluate the model’s performance on Winograd Schema-like tasks. In Section 3.5 we\\nevaluate on datasets that involve commonsense reasoning or question answering. In Section 3.6 we evaluate on reading\\ncomprehension tasks, in Section 3.7 we evaluate on the SuperGLUE benchmark suite, and in 3.8 we brieﬂy explore\\nNLI. Finally, in Section 3.9, we invent some additional tasks designed especially to probe in-context learning abilities –\\nthese tasks focus on on-the-ﬂy reasoning, adaptation skills, or open-ended text synthesis.

We omit\\nthe 4 Wikipedia-related tasks in that work because they are entirely contained in our training data, and we also omit the\\none-billion word benchmark due to a high fraction of the dataset being contained in our training set. PTB escapes these\\nissues due to predating the modern internet. Our largest model sets a new SOTA on PTB by a substantial margin of 15\\npoints, achieving a perplexity of 20.50. Note that since PTB is a traditional language modeling dataset it does not have\\na clear separation of examples to deﬁne one-shot or few-shot evaluation around, so we measure only zero-shot.\\n3.1.2 LAMBADA\\nThe LAMBADA dataset [PKL+16] tests the modeling of long-range dependencies in text – the model is asked to\\npredict the last word of sentences which require reading a paragraph of context. It has recently been suggested that the\\ncontinued scaling of language models is yielding diminishing returns on this difﬁcult benchmark.

We ﬁnd that path is still promising and in a zero-shot setting GPT-3 achieves 76% on LAMBADA, a gain of\\n8% over the previous state of the art.\\nLAMBADA is also a demonstration of the ﬂexibility of few-shot learning as it provides a way to address a problem that\\nclassically occurs with this dataset. Although the completion in LAMBADA is always the last word in a sentence, a\\nstandard language model has no way of knowing this detail. It thus assigns probability not only to the correct ending but\\nalso to other valid continuations of the paragraph. This problem has been partially addressed in the past with stop-word\\nﬁlters [RWC+19] (which ban “continuation” words). The few-shot setting instead allows us to “frame” the task as a\\ncloze-test and allows the language model to infer from examples that a completion of exactly one word is desired.

We observe that few-shot performance improves strongly with model\\nsize. While this setting decreases the performance of the smallest model by almost 20%, for GPT-3 it improves accuracy\\nby 10%. Finally, the ﬁll-in-blank method is not effective one-shot, where it always performs worse than the zero-shot\\nsetting. Perhaps this is because all models still require several examples to recognize the pattern.\\n12'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='Setting NaturalQS WebQS TriviaQA\\nRAG (Fine-tuned, Open-Domain) [LPP+20] 44.5 45.5 68.0\\nT5-11B+SSM (Fine-tuned, Closed-Book) [RRS20] 36.6 44.7 60.5\\nT5-11B (Fine-tuned, Closed-Book) 34.5 37.4 50.1\\nGPT-3 Zero-Shot 14.6 14.4 64.3\\nGPT-3 One-Shot 23.0 25.3 68.0\\nGPT-3 Few-Shot 29.9 41.5 71.2\\nTable 3.3: Results on three Open-Domain QA tasks.

Here GPT-3 achieves 83.2% in the zero-shot setting and 87.7% in the few-shot\\nsetting (with K = 70). This is still 4.1% lower than the ﬁne-tuned SOTA using a BERT based model [ LDL19] but\\nimproves over previous zero-shot results by roughly 10%.\\n3.2 Closed Book Question Answering\\nIn this section we measure GPT-3’s ability to answer questions about broad factual knowledge. Due to the immense\\namount of possible queries, this task has normally been approached by using an information retrieval system to ﬁnd\\nrelevant text in combination with a model which learns to generate an answer given the question and the retrieved\\ntext. Since this setting allows a system to search for and condition on text which potentially contains the answer it\\nis denoted “open-book”. [RRS20] recently demonstrated that a large language model can perform surprisingly well\\ndirectly answering the questions without conditioning on auxilliary information. They denote this more restrictive\\nevaluation setting as “closed-book”. Their work suggests that even higher-capacity models could perform even better\\nand we test this hypothesis with GPT-3. We evaluate GPT-3 on the 3 datasets in [RRS20]: Natural Questions [KPR+19],\\nWebQuestions [BCFL13], and TriviaQA [JCWZ17], using the same splits. Note that in addition to all results being in\\nthe closed-book setting, our use of few-shot, one-shot, and zero-shot evaluations represent an even stricter setting than\\nprevious closed-book QA work: in addition to external content not being allowed, ﬁne-tuning on the Q&A dataset itself\\nis also not permitted.\\nThe results for GPT-3 are shown in Table 3.3. On TriviaQA, we achieve 64.3% in the zero-shot setting, 68.0% in the\\none-shot setting, and 71.2% in the few-shot setting. The zero-shot result already outperforms the ﬁne-tuned T5-11B by\\n14.2%, and also outperforms a version with Q&A tailored span prediction during pre-training by 3.8%. The one-shot\\nresult improves by 3.7% and matches the SOTA for an open-domain QA system which not only ﬁne-tunes but also\\nmakes use of a learned retrieval mechanism over a 15.3B parameter dense vector index of 21M documents [LPP+20].\\nGPT-3’s few-shot result further improves performance another 3.2% beyond this.\\nOn WebQuestions (WebQs), GPT-3 achieves 14.4% in the zero-shot setting, 25.3% in the one-shot setting, and 41.5%\\nin the few-shot setting. This compares to 37.4% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B, and 44.7% for ﬁne-tuned T5-11B+SSM,\\nwhich uses a Q&A-speciﬁc pre-training procedure. GPT-3 in the few-shot setting approaches the performance of\\nstate-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned models. Notably, compared to TriviaQA, WebQS shows a much larger gain from zero-shot to\\nfew-shot (and indeed its zero-shot and one-shot performance are poor), perhaps suggesting that the WebQs questions\\n13'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='Figure 3.3: On TriviaQA GPT3’s performance grows smoothly with model size, suggesting that language models\\ncontinue to absorb knowledge as their capacity increases.

Nevertheless, GPT-3 appears able to adapt to this\\ndistribution, recovering strong performance in the few-shot setting.\\nOn Natural Questions (NQs) GPT-3 achieves 14.6% in the zero-shot setting, 23.0% in the one-shot setting, and 29.9% in\\nthe few-shot setting, compared to 36.6% for ﬁne-tuned T5 11B+SSM. Similar to WebQS, the large gain from zero-shot\\nto few-shot may suggest a distribution shift, and may also explain the less competitive performance compared to\\nTriviaQA and WebQS. In particular, the questions in NQs tend towards very ﬁne-grained knowledge on Wikipedia\\nspeciﬁcally which could be testing the limits of GPT-3’s capacity and broad pretraining distribution.\\nOverall, on one of the three datasets GPT-3’s one-shot matches the open-domain ﬁne-tuning SOTA. On the other two\\ndatasets it approaches the performance of the closed-book SOTA despite not using ﬁne-tuning. On all 3 datasets, we\\nﬁnd that performance scales very smoothly with model size (Figure 3.3 and Appendix H Figure H.7), possibly reﬂecting\\nthe idea that model capacity translates directly to more ‘knowledge’ absorbed in the parameters of the model.\\n3.3 Translation\\nFor GPT-2 a ﬁlter was used on a multilingual collection of documents to produce an English only dataset due to capacity\\nconcerns. Even with this ﬁltering GPT-2 showed some evidence of multilingual capability and performed non-trivially\\nwhen translating between French and English despite only training on 10 megabytes of remaining French text. Since we\\nincrease the capacity by over two orders of magnitude from GPT-2 to GPT-3, we also expand the scope of the training\\ndataset to include more representation of other languages, though this remains an area for further improvement. As\\ndiscussed in 2.2 the majority of our data is derived from raw Common Crawl with only quality-based ﬁltering. Although\\nGPT-3’s training data is still primarily English (93% by word count), it also includes 7% of text in other languages.\\nThese languages are documented in the supplemental material. In order to better understand translation capability, we\\nalso expand our analysis to include two additional commonly studied languages, German and Romanian.\\nExisting unsupervised machine translation approaches often combine pretraining on a pair of monolingual datasets\\nwith back-translation [SHB15] to bridge the two languages in a controlled way. By contrast, GPT-3 learns from a\\nblend of training data that mixes many languages together in a natural way, combining them on a word, sentence,\\nand document level. GPT-3 also uses a single training objective which is not customized or designed for any task in\\nparticular. However, our one / few-shot settings aren’t strictly comparable to prior unsupervised work since they make\\nuse of a small amount of paired examples (1 or 64). This corresponds to up to a page or two of in-context training data.\\nResults are shown in Table 3.4.

Note that this setting differs slightly from the WSC task in the SuperGLUE benchmark, which\\nis presented as binary classiﬁcation and requires entity extraction to convert to the form described in this section. On\\nWinograd GPT-3 achieves 88.3%, 89.7%, and 88.6% in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, showing no clear\\nin-context learning but in all cases achieving strong results just a few points below state-of-the-art and estimated human\\nperformance. We note that contamination analysis found some Winograd schemas in the training data but this appears\\nto have only a small effect on results (see Section 4).\\nOn the more difﬁcult Winogrande dataset, we do ﬁnd gains to in-context learning: GPT-3 achieves 70.2% in the\\nzero-shot setting, 73.2% in the one-shot setting, and 77.7% in the few-shot setting.

See Section 4 for details.\\nARC [CCE+18] is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the\\n“Challenge” version of the dataset which has been ﬁltered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval\\nmethods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot\\nsetting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a ﬁne-tuned RoBERTa baseline\\n(55.9%) from UniﬁedQA [KKS+20]. On the “Easy” version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned\\nbaseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a ﬁne-tuned\\nRoBERTa baseline from [KKS+20]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs\\nachieved by the UniﬁedQA which exceeds GPT-3’s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy\\nset.\\nOn OpenBookQA [MCKS18], GPT-3 improves signiﬁcantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points\\nshort of the overall SOTA.

GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings.\\n3.6 Reading Comprehension\\nNext we evaluate GPT-3 on the task of reading comprehension. We use a suite of 5 datasets including abstractive,\\nmultiple choice, and span based answer formats in both dialog and single question settings. We observe a wide spread\\nin GPT-3’s performance across these datasets suggestive of varying capability with different answer formats. In general\\nwe observe GPT-3 is on par with initial baselines and early results trained using contextual representations on each\\nrespective dataset.\\nGPT-3 performs best (within 3 points of the human baseline) on CoQA [RCM19] a free-form conversational dataset\\nand performs worst (13 F1 below an ELMo baseline) on QuAC [CHI+18] a dataset which requires modeling structured\\ndialog acts and answer span selections of teacher-student interactions. On DROP [DWD+19], a dataset testing discrete\\nreasoning and numeracy in the context of reading comprehension, GPT-3 in a few-shot setting outperforms the ﬁne-tuned\\nBERT baseline from the original paper but is still well below both human performance and state-of-the-art approaches\\nwhich augment neural networks with symbolic systems [RLL+19]. On SQuAD 2.0 [RJL18], GPT-3 demonstrates its\\nfew-shot learning capabilities, improving by almost 10 F1 (to 69.8) compared to a zero-shot setting. This allows it to\\nslightly outperform the best ﬁne-tuned result in the original paper. On RACE [LXL+17], a multiple choice dataset of\\nmiddle school and high school english examinations, GPT-3 performs relatively weakly and is only competitive with\\nthe earliest work utilizing contextual representations and is still 45% behind SOTA.\\n3.7 SuperGLUE\\nIn order to better aggregate results on NLP tasks and compare to popular models such as BERT and RoBERTa in a\\nmore systematic way, we also evaluate GPT-3 on a standardized collection of datasets, the SuperGLUE benchmark\\n[WPN+19] [WPN+19] [CLC+19] [DMST19] [RBG11] [KCR+18] [ZLL+18] [DGM06] [BHDD+06] [GMDD07]\\n[BDD+09] [PCC18] [PHR+18].

On WSC,\\nperformance is still relatively strong, achieving 80.1% in the few-shot setting (note that GPT-3 achieves 88.6% on the\\noriginal Winograd dataset as described in Section 3.4). On BoolQ, MultiRC, and RTE, performance is reasonable,\\nroughly matching that of a ﬁne-tuned BERT-Large. On CB, we see signs of life at 75.6% in the few-shot setting.\\nWiC is a notable weak spot with few-shot performance at 49.4% (at random chance). We tried a number of different\\nphrasings and formulations for WiC (which involves determining if a word is being used with the same meaning in two\\nsentences), none of which was able to achieve strong performance. This hints at a phenomenon that will become clearer\\nin the next section (which discusses the ANLI benchmark) – GPT-3 appears to be weak in the few-shot or one-shot\\nsetting at some tasks that involve comparing two sentences or snippets, for example whether a word is used the same\\nway in two sentences (WiC), whether one sentence is a paraphrase of another, or whether one sentence implies another.\\nThis could also explain the comparatively low scores for RTE and CB, which also follow this format. Despite these\\nweaknesses, GPT-3 still outperforms a ﬁne-tuned BERT-large on four of eight tasks and on two tasks GPT-3 is close to\\nthe state-of-the-art held by a ﬁne-tuned 11 billion parameter model.\\nFinally, we note that the few-shot SuperGLUE score steadily improves with both model size and with number of\\nexamples in the context showing increasing beneﬁts from in-context learning (Figure 3.8). We scale K up to 32\\nexamples per task, after which point additional examples will not reliably ﬁt into our context. When sweeping over\\nvalues of K, we ﬁnd that GPT-3 requires less than eight total examples per task to outperform a ﬁne-tuned BERT-Large\\non overall SuperGLUE score.\\n3.8 NLI\\nNatural Language Inference (NLI) [Fyo00] concerns the ability to understand the relationship between two sentences.\\nIn practice, this task is usually structured as a two or three class classiﬁcation problem where the model classiﬁes\\n20'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 20}, page_content='Figure 3.9: Performance of GPT-3 on ANLI Round 3.

We ﬁnd that smaller models hover around\\nrandom chance, while few-shot GPT-3 175B closes almost half the gap from random chance to SOTA. Results for\\nANLI rounds 1 and 2 are shown in the appendix.\\nwhether the second sentence logically follows from the ﬁrst, contradicts the ﬁrst sentence, or is possibly true (neutral).\\nSuperGLUE includes an NLI dataset, RTE, which evaluates the binary version of the task. On RTE, only the largest\\nversion of GPT-3 performs convincingly better than random (56%) in any evaluation setting, but in a few-shot setting\\nGPT-3 performs similarly to a single-task ﬁne-tuned BERT Large. We also evaluate on the recently introduced\\nAdversarial Natural Language Inference (ANLI) dataset [NWD+19]. ANLI is a difﬁcult dataset employing a series of\\nadversarially mined natural language inference questions in three rounds (R1, R2, and R3). Similar to RTE, all of our\\nmodels smaller than GPT-3 perform at almost exactly random chance on ANLI, even in the few-shot setting (∼33%),\\nwhereas GPT-3 itself shows signs of life on Round 3. Results for ANLI R3 are highlighted in Figure 3.9 and full results\\nfor all rounds can be found in Appendix H. These results on both RTE and ANLI suggest that NLI is still a very difﬁcult\\ntask for language models and they are only just beginning to show signs of progress.\\n3.9 Synthetic and Qualitative Tasks\\nOne way to probe GPT-3’s range of abilities in the few-shot (or zero- and one-shot) setting is to give it tasks which\\nrequire it to perform simple on-the-ﬂy computational reasoning, recognize a novel pattern that is unlikely to have\\noccurred in training, or adapt quickly to an unusual task. We devise several tasks to test this class of abilities. First, we\\ntest GPT-3’s ability to perform arithmetic. Second, we create several tasks that involve rearranging or unscrambling the\\nletters in a word, tasks which are unlikely to have been exactly seen during training. Third, we test GPT-3’s ability to\\nsolve SAT-style analogy problems few-shot. Finally, we test GPT-3 on several qualitative tasks, including using new\\nwords in a sentence, correcting English grammar, and news article generation. We will release the synthetic datasets\\nwith the hope of stimulating further study of test-time behavior of language models.\\n3.9.1 Arithmetic\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to perform simple arithmetic operations without task-speciﬁc training, we developed a small\\nbattery of 10 tests that involve asking GPT-3 a simple arithmetic problem in natural language:\\n• 2 digit addition (2D+) – The model is asked to add two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100), phrased in\\nthe form of a question, e.g. “Q: What is 48 plus 76? A: 124.”\\n• 2 digit subtraction (2D-) – The model is asked to subtract two integers sampled uniformly from [0,100); the\\nanswer may be negative. Example: “Q: What is 34 minus 53? A: -19”.\\n• 3 digit addition (3D+) – Same as 2 digit addition, except numbers are uniformly sampled from [0,1000).\\n21'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 21}, page_content='Figure 3.10: Results on all 10 arithmetic tasks in the few-shot settings for models of different sizes.

A: 38”. The three 1 digit numbers\\nare selected uniformly on [0,10) and the operations are selected uniformly from {+,-,*}.\\nIn all 10 tasks the model must generate the correct answer exactly. For each task we generate a dataset of 2,000 random\\ninstances of the task and evaluate all models on those instances.\\nFirst we evaluate GPT-3 in the few-shot setting, for which results are shown in Figure 3.10. On addition and subtraction,\\nGPT-3 displays strong proﬁciency when the number of digits is small, achieving 100% accuracy on 2 digit addition,\\n98.9% at 2 digit subtraction, 80.2% at 3 digit addition, and 94.2% at 3-digit subtraction. Performance decreases as the\\nnumber of digits increases, but GPT-3 still achieves 25-26% accuracy on four digit operations and 9-10% accuracy on\\nﬁve digit operations, suggesting at least some capacity to generalize to larger numbers of digits. GPT-3 also achieves\\n29.2% accuracy at 2 digit multiplication, an especially computationally intensive operation. Finally, GPT-3 achieves\\n21.3% accuracy at single digit combined operations (for example, 9*(7+5)), suggesting that it has some robustness\\nbeyond just single operations.\\nAs Figure 3.10 makes clear, small models do poorly on all of these tasks – even the 13 billion parameter model (the\\nsecond largest after the 175 billion full GPT-3) can solve 2 digit addition and subtraction only half the time, and all\\nother operations less than 10% of the time.\\nOne-shot and zero-shot performance are somewhat degraded relative to few-shot performance, suggesting that adaptation\\nto the task (or at the very least recognition of the task) is important to performing these computations correctly.\\nNevertheless, one-shot performance is still quite strong, and even zero-shot performance of the full GPT-3 signiﬁcantly\\n22'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='Setting 2D+ 2D- 3D+ 3D- 4D+ 4D- 5D+ 5D- 2Dx 1DC\\nGPT-3 Zero-shot 76.9 58.0 34.2 48.3 4.0 7.5 0.7 0.8 19.8 9.8\\nGPT-3 One-shot 99.6 86.4 65.5 78.7 14.0 14.0 3.5 3.8 27.4 14.3\\nGPT-3 Few-shot 100.0 98.9 80.4 94.2 25.5 26.8 9.3 9.9 29.2 21.3\\nTable 3.9: Results on basic arithmetic tasks for GPT-3 175B. {2,3,4,5}D{+,-}is 2, 3, 4, and 5 digit addition or\\nsubtraction, 2Dx is 2 digit multiplication. 1DC is 1 digit composite operations.

Out of 2,000 addition problems we found only 17 matches (0.8%) and out of 2,000\\nsubtraction problems we found only 2 matches (0.1%), suggesting that only a trivial fraction of the correct answers\\ncould have been memorized. In addition, inspection of incorrect answers reveals that the model often makes mistakes\\nsuch as not carrying a “1”, suggesting it is actually attempting to perform the relevant computation rather than\\nmemorizing a table.\\nOverall, GPT-3 displays reasonable proﬁciency at moderately complex arithmetic in few-shot, one-shot, and even\\nzero-shot settings.\\n3.9.2 Word Scrambling and Manipulation Tasks\\nTo test GPT-3’s ability to learn novel symbolic manipulations from a few examples, we designed a small battery of\\n5 “character manipulation” tasks. Each task involves giving the model a word distorted by some combination of\\nscrambling, addition, or deletion of characters, and asking it to recover the original word. The 5 tasks are:\\n• Cycle letters in word (CL) – The model is given a word with its letters cycled, then the “=” symbol, and\\nis expected to generate the original word. For example, it might be given “lyinevitab” and should output\\n“inevitably”.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last characters (A1) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst and last have been scrambled randomly, and must output the original word. Example: criroptuon =\\ncorruption.\\n• Anagrams of all but ﬁrst and last 2 characters (A2) – The model is given a word where every letter except\\nthe ﬁrst 2 and last 2 have been scrambled randomly, and must recover the original word. Example: opoepnnt\\n→opponent.\\n• Random insertion in word (RI) – A random punctuation or space character is inserted between each letter\\nof a word, and the model must output the original word. Example: s.u!c/c!e.s s i/o/n = succession.\\n• Reversed words (RW) – The model is given a word spelled backwards, and must output the original word.\\nExample: stcejbo →objects.\\nFor each task we generate 10,000 examples, which we chose to be the top 10,000 most frequent words as measured by\\n[Nor09] of length more than 4 characters and less than 15 characters. The few-shot results are shown in Figure 3.11.\\nTask performance tends to grow smoothly with model size, with the full GPT-3 model achieving 66.9% on removing\\n23'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='Figure 3.11: Few-shot performance on the ﬁve word scrambling tasks for different sizes of model. There is generally\\nsmooth improvement with model size although the random insertion task shows an upward slope of improvement with\\nthe 175B model solving the task the majority of the time. Scaling of one-shot and zero-shot performance is shown in\\nthe appendix. All tasks are done with K = 100.\\nrandom insertions, 38.6% on cycling letters, 40.2% on the easier anagram task, and 15.1% on the more difﬁcult anagram\\ntask (where only the ﬁrst and last letters are held ﬁxed). None of the models can reverse the letters in a word.\\nIn the one-shot setting, performance is signiﬁcantly weaker (dropping by half or more), and in the zero-shot setting the\\nmodel can rarely perform any of the tasks (Table 3.10). This suggests that the model really does appear to learn these\\ntasks at test time, as the model cannot perform them zero-shot and their artiﬁcial nature makes them unlikely to appear\\nin the pre-training data (although we cannot conﬁrm this with certainty).\\nWe can further quantify performance by plotting “in-context learning curves”, which show task performance as a\\nfunction of the number of in-context examples. We show in-context learning curves for the Symbol Insertion task\\nin Figure 1.2. We can see that larger models are able to make increasingly effective use of in-context information,\\nincluding both task examples and natural language task descriptions.\\nFinally, it is worth adding that solving these tasks requires character-level manipulations, whereas our BPE encoding\\noperates on signiﬁcant fractions of a word (on average∼0.7 words per token), so from the LM’s perspective succeeding\\nat these tasks involves not just manipulating BPE tokens but understanding and pulling apart their substructure. Also,\\nCL, A1, and A2 are not bijective (that is, the unscrambled word is not a deterministic function of the scrambled word),\\nrequiring the model to perform some search to ﬁnd the correct unscrambling. Thus, the skills involved appear to require\\nnon-trivial pattern-matching and computation.\\n3.9.3 SAT Analogies\\nTo test GPT-3 on another task that is somewhat unusual relative to the typical distribution of text, we collected a set of\\n374 “SAT analogy” problems [TLBS03]. Analogies are a style of multiple choice question that constituted a section of\\nthe SAT college entrance exam before 2005. A typical example is “audacious is to boldness as (a) sanctimonious is to\\nhypocrisy, (b) anonymous is to identity, (c) remorseful is to misdeed, (d) deleterious is to result, (e) impressionable is to\\ntemptation”. The student is expected to choose which of the ﬁve word pairs has the same relationship as the original\\nword pair; in this example the answer is “sanctimonious is to hypocrisy”. On this task GPT-3 achieves 65.2% in the\\nfew-shot setting, 59.1% in the one-shot setting, and 53.7% in the zero-shot setting, whereas the average score among\\ncollege applicants was 57% [TL05] (random guessing yields 20%). As shown in Figure 3.12, the results improve with\\nscale, with the the full 175 billion model improving by over 10% compared to the 13 billion parameter model.\\n24'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 24}, page_content='Figure 3.12: Zero-, one-,and few-shot performance on SAT analogy tasks, for different sizes of model. The largest\\nmodel achieves 65% accuracy in the few-shot setting, and also demonstrates signiﬁcant gains to in-context learning\\nwhich are not present in smaller models.\\n3.9.4 News Article Generation\\nPrevious work on generative language models qualitatively tested their ability to generate synthetic “news articles” by\\nconditional sampling from the model given a human-written prompt consisting of a plausible ﬁrst sentence for a news\\nstory [RWC+19]. Relative to [RWC+19], the dataset used to train GPT-3 is much less weighted towards news articles,\\nso trying to generate news articles via raw unconditional samples is less effective – for example GPT-3 often interprets\\nthe proposed ﬁrst sentence of a “news article” as a tweet and then posts synthetic responses or follow-up tweets. To\\nsolve this problem we employed GPT-3’s few-shot learning abilities by providing three previous news articles in the\\nmodel’s context to condition it. With the title and subtitle of a proposed next article, the model is able to reliably\\ngenerate short articles in the “news” genre.\\nTo gauge the quality of news article generation from GPT-3 (which we believe is likely to be correlated with conditional\\nsample generation quality in general), we decided to measure human ability to distinguish GPT-3-generated articles\\nfrom real ones. Similar work has been carried out by Kreps et al. [KMB20] and Zellers et al. [ZHR+19]. Generative\\nlanguage models are trained to match the distribution of content generated by humans, so the (in)ability of humans to\\ndistinguish the two is a potentially important measure of quality.3\\nIn order to see how well humans can detect model generated text, we arbitrarily selected 25 article titles and subtitles\\nfrom the website newser.com (mean length: 215 words). We then generated completions of these titles and subtitles\\nfrom four language models ranging in size from 125M to 175B (GPT-3) parameters (mean length: 200 words). For each\\nmodel, we presented around 80 US-based participants with a quiz consisting of these real titles and subtitles followed\\nby either the human written article or the article generated by the model4. Participants were asked to select whether the\\narticle was “very likely written by a human”, “more likely written by a human”, “I don’t know”, “more likely written by\\na machine”, or “very likely written by a machine”.\\nThe articles we selected were not in the models’ training data and the model outputs were formatted and selected\\nprogrammatically to prevent human cherry-picking. All models used the same context to condition outputs on and were\\npre-trained with the same context size and the same article titles and subtitles were used as prompts for each model.\\nHowever, we also ran an experiment to control for participant effort and attention that followed the same format but\\ninvolved intentionally bad model generated articles. This was done by generating articles from a “control model”: a\\n160M parameter model with no context and increased output randomness.\\n3This task is also relevant to the potential misuse of language models discussed in Section 6.1.\\n4We wanted to identify how good an average person on the internet is at detecting language model outputs, so we focused on\\nparticipants drawn from the general US population.

Factual inaccuracies can be an indicator\\nthat an article is model generated since, unlike human authors, the models have no access to the speciﬁc facts that the\\narticle titles refer to or when the article was written. Other indicators include repetition, non sequiturs, and unusual\\nphrasings, though these are often subtle enough that they are not noticed.\\nRelated work on language model detection by Ippolito et al. [IDCBE19] indicates that automatic discriminators like\\nG R O V E R[ZHR+19] and GLTR [GSR19] may have greater success at detecting model generated text than human\\nevaluators. Automatic detection of these models may be a promising area of future research.\\nIppolito et al. [IDCBE19] also note that human accuracy at detecting model generated text increases as humans observe\\nmore tokens. To do a preliminary investigation of how good humans are at detecting longer news articles generated\\nby GPT-3 175B, we selected 12 world news articles from Reuters with an average length of 569 words and generated\\ncompletions of these articles from GPT-3 with an average length of 498 words (298 words longer than our initial\\nexperiments). Following the methodology above, we ran two experiments, each on around 80 US-based participants, to\\ncompare human abilities to detect the articles generated by GPT-3 and a control model.\\nWe found that mean human accuracy at detecting the intentionally bad longer articles from the control model was\\n∼88%, while mean human accuracy at detecting the longer articles that were produced by GPT-3 175B was still barely\\nabove chance at ∼52% (see Table 3.12). This indicates that, for news articles that are around 500 words long, GPT-3\\ncontinues to produce articles that humans ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human written news articles.\\n3.9.5 Learning and Using Novel Words\\nA task studied in developmental linguistics [CB78] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a\\nword in a sentence after seeing it deﬁned only once, or conversely inferring a word’s meaning from only one usage.

On the one hand, the dataset and model size are about two orders of\\nmagnitude larger than those used for GPT-2, and include a large amount of Common Crawl, creating increased potential\\nfor contamination and memorization. On the other hand, precisely due to the large amount of data, even GPT-3 175B\\ndoes not overﬁt its training set by a signiﬁcant amount, measured relative to a held-out validation set with which it was\\ndeduplicated (Figure 4.1). Thus, we expect that contamination is likely to be frequent, but that its effects may not be as\\nlarge as feared.\\nWe initially tried to address the issue of contamination by proactively searching for and attempting to remove any overlap\\nbetween our training data and the development and test sets of all benchmarks studied in this paper. Unfortunately, a\\nbug resulted in only partial removal of all detected overlaps from the training data. Due to the cost of training, it wasn’t\\nfeasible to retrain the model. To address this, we investigate in detail how the remaining detected overlap impacts\\nresults.\\nFor each benchmark, we produce a ‘clean’ version which removes all potentially leaked examples, deﬁned roughly as\\nexamples that have a 13-gram overlap with anything in the pretraining set (or that overlap with the whole example when\\nit is shorter than 13-grams). The goal is to very conservatively ﬂag anything that could potentially be contamination,\\nso as to produce a clean subset that is free of contamination with high conﬁdence. The exact procedure is detailed in\\nAppendix C.\\nWe then evaluate GPT-3 on these clean benchmarks, and compare to the original score. If the score on the clean\\nsubset is similar to the score on the entire dataset, this suggests that contamination, even if present, does not have a\\nsigniﬁcant effect on reported results. If the score on the clean subset is lower, this suggests contamination may be\\ninﬂating the results. The results are summarized in Figure 4.2. Although potential contamination is often high (with a\\nquarter of benchmarks scoring over 50%), in most cases performance changes only negligibly, and we see no evidence\\nthat contamination level and performance difference are correlated. We conclude that either our conservative method\\nsubstantially overestimated contamination or that contamination has little effect on performance.\\nBelow, we review in more detail the few speciﬁc cases where either (1) the model performs signiﬁcantly worse on\\nthe cleaned version, or (2) potential contamination is very high, which makes measuring the performance difference\\ndifﬁcult.\\nOur analysis ﬂagged six groups of benchmarks for further investigation: Word Scrambling, Reading Comprehension\\n(QuAC, SQuAD2, DROP), PIQA, Winograd, language modeling tasks (Wikitext tasks, 1BW), and German to English\\n31'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='Figure 4.2: Benchmark contamination analysis We constructed cleaned versions of each of our benchmarks to\\ncheck for potential contamination in our training set.

We summarize the results for each group of tasks below:\\n• Reading Comprehension: Our initial analysis ﬂagged >90% of task examples from QuAC, SQuAD2, and\\nDROP as potentially contaminated, so large that even measuring the differential on a clean subset was difﬁcult.\\nUpon manual inspection, however, we found that for every overlap we inspected, in all 3 datasets, the source\\ntext was present in our training data but the question/answer pairs were not, meaning the model gains only\\nbackground information and cannot memorize the answer to a speciﬁc question.\\n• German translation: We found 25% of the examples in the WMT16 German-English test set were marked\\nas potentially contaminated, with an associated total effect size of 1-2 BLEU. Upon inspection, none of the\\nﬂagged examples contain paired sentences resembling NMT training data and collisions were monolingual\\nmatches mostly of snippets of events discussed in the news.\\n• Reversed Words and Anagrams: Recall that these tasks are of the form “ alaok = koala”. Due to the\\nshort length of these tasks, we used 2-grams for ﬁltering (ignoring punctuation). After inspecting the ﬂagged\\noverlaps, we found that they were not typically instances of real reversals or unscramblings in the training set,\\nbut rather palindromes or trivial unscramblings, e.g “kayak = kayak”. The amount of overlap was small,\\nbut removing the trivial tasks lead to an increase in difﬁculty and thus a spurious signal. Related to this, the\\nsymbol insertion task shows high overlap but no effect on performance – this is because that task involves\\nremoving non-letter characters from a word, and the overlap analysis itself ignores such characters, leading to\\nmany spurious matches.\\n• PIQA: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 29% of examples as contaminated, and observed a 3 percentage point\\nabsolute decrease (4% relative decrease) in performance on the clean subset. Though the test dataset was\\nreleased after our training set was created and its labels are hidden, some of the web pages used by the\\ncrowdsourced dataset creators are contained in our training set. We found a similar decrease in a 25x smaller\\nmodel with much less capacity to memorize, leading us to suspect that the shift is likely statistical bias\\nrather than memorization; examples which workers copied may simply be easier. Unfortunately, we cannot\\nrigorously prove this hypothesis. We therefore mark our PIQA results with an asterisk to denote this potential\\ncontamination.\\n• Winograd: The overlap analysis ﬂagged 45% of examples, and found a 2.6% decrease in performance on the\\nclean subset. Manual inspection of the overlapping data point showed that 132 Winograd schemas were in\\nfact present in our training set, though presented in a different format than we present the task to the model.\\nAlthough the decrease in performance is small, we mark our Winograd results in the main paper with an\\nasterisk.\\n32'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='• Language modeling: We found the 4 Wikipedia language modeling benchmarks measured in GPT-2, plus the\\nChildren’s Book Test dataset, to be almost entirely contained in our training data. Since we cannot reliably\\nextract a clean subset here, we do not report results on these datasets, even though we intended to when starting\\nthis work. We note that Penn Tree Bank due to its age was unaffected and therefore became our chief language\\nmodeling benchmark.\\nWe also inspected datasets where contamination was high, but the impact on performance was close to zero, simply\\nto verify how much actual contamination existed. These appeared to often contain false positives. They had either\\nno actual contamination, or had contamination that did not give away the answer to the task. One notable exception\\nwas LAMBADA, which appeared to have substantial genuine contamination, yet the impact on performance was very\\nsmall, with the clean subset scoring within 0.5% of the full dataset. Also, strictly speaking, our ﬁll-in-the-blank format\\nprecludes the simplest form of memorization. Nevertheless, since we made very large gains on LAMBADA in this\\npaper, the potential contamination is noted in the results section.\\nAn important limitation of our contamination analysis is that we cannot be sure that the clean subset is drawn from the\\nsame distribution as the original dataset. It remains possible that memorization inﬂates results but at the same time\\nis precisely counteracted by some statistical bias causing the clean subset to be easier. However, the sheer number\\nof shifts close to zero suggests this is unlikely, and we also observed no noticeable difference in the shifts for small\\nmodels, which are unlikely to be memorizing.\\nOverall, we have made a best effort to measure and document the effects of data contamination, and to note or outright\\nremove problematic results, depending on the severity. Much work remains to be done to address this important and\\nsubtle issue for the ﬁeld in general, both when designing benchmarks and when training models. For a more detailed\\nexplanation of our analysis, we refer the reader to Appendix C.\\n5 Limitations\\nGPT-3 and our analysis of it have a number of limitations. Below we describe some of these and suggest directions for\\nfuture work.\\nFirst, despite the strong quantitative and qualitative improvements of GPT-3, particularly compared to its direct\\npredecessor GPT-2, it still has notable weaknesses in text synthesis and several NLP tasks. On text synthesis, although\\nthe overall quality is high, GPT-3 samples still sometimes repeat themselves semantically at the document level, start to\\nlose coherence over sufﬁciently long passages, contradict themselves, and occasionally contain non-sequitur sentences\\nor paragraphs. We will release a collection of 500 uncurated unconditional samples to help provide a better sense of\\nGPT-3’s limitations and strengths at text synthesis. Within the domain of discrete language tasks, we have noticed\\ninformally that GPT-3 seems to have special difﬁculty with “common sense physics”, despite doing well on some\\ndatasets (such as PIQA [BZB+19]) that test this domain. Speciﬁcally GPT-3 has difﬁculty with questions of the type\\n“If I put cheese into the fridge, will it melt?”. Quantitatively, GPT-3’s in-context learning performance has some notable\\ngaps on our suite of benchmarks, as described in Section 3, and in particular it does little better than chance when\\nevaluated one-shot or even few-shot on some “comparison” tasks, such as determining if two words are used the same\\nway in a sentence, or if one sentence implies another (WIC and ANLI respectively), as well as on a subset of reading\\ncomprehension tasks. This is especially striking given GPT-3’s strong few-shot performance on many other tasks.\\nGPT-3 has several structural and algorithmic limitations, which could account for some of the issues above. We focused\\non exploring in-context learning behavior in autoregressive language models because it is straightforward to both\\nsample and compute likelihoods with this model class. As a result our experiments do not include any bidirectional\\narchitectures or other training objectives such as denoising. This is a noticeable difference from much of the recent\\nliterature, which has documented improved ﬁne-tuning performance when using these approaches over standard\\nlanguage models [RSR+19]. Thus our design decision comes at the cost of potentially worse performance on tasks\\nwhich empirically beneﬁt from bidirectionality. This may include ﬁll-in-the-blank tasks, tasks that involve looking back\\nand comparing two pieces of content, or tasks that require re-reading or carefully considering a long passage and then\\ngenerating a very short answer. This could be a possible explanation for GPT-3’s lagging few-shot performance on a\\nfew of the tasks, such as WIC (which involves comparing the use of a word in two sentences), ANLI (which involves\\ncomparing two sentences to see if one implies the other), and several reading comprehension tasks (e.g. QuAC and\\nRACE). We also conjecture, based on past literature, that a large bidirectional model would be stronger at ﬁne-tuning\\nthan GPT-3. Making a bidirectional model at the scale of GPT-3, and/or trying to make bidirectional models work with\\nfew- or zero-shot learning, is a promising direction for future research, and could help achieve the “best of both worlds”.\\nA more fundamental limitation of the general approach described in this paper – scaling up any LM-like model, whether\\nautoregressive or bidirectional – is that it may eventually run into (or could already be running into) the limits of the\\n33'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='pretraining objective. Our current objective weights every token equally and lacks a notion of what is most important to\\npredict and what is less important. [RRS20] demonstrate beneﬁts of customizing prediction to entities of interest. Also,\\nwith self-supervised objectives, task speciﬁcation relies on forcing the desired task into a prediction problem, whereas\\nultimately, useful language systems (for example virtual assistants) might be better thought of as taking goal-directed\\nactions rather than just making predictions. Finally, large pretrained language models are not grounded in other domains\\nof experience, such as video or real-world physical interaction, and thus lack a large amount of context about the world\\n[BHT+20]. For all these reasons, scaling pure self-supervised prediction is likely to hit limits, and augmentation with a\\ndifferent approach is likely to be necessary. Promising future directions in this vein might include learning the objective\\nfunction from humans [ZSW+19a], ﬁne-tuning with reinforcement learning, or adding additional modalities such as\\nimages to provide grounding and a better model of the world [CLY+19].\\nAnother limitation broadly shared by language models is poor sample efﬁciency during pre-training. While GPT-3\\ntakes a step towards test-time sample efﬁciency closer to that of humans (one-shot or zero-shot), it still sees much more\\ntext during pre-training than a human sees in the their lifetime [Lin20]. Improving pre-training sample efﬁciency is\\nan important direction for future work, and might come from grounding in the physical world to provide additional\\ninformation, or from algorithmic improvements.\\nA limitation, or at least uncertainty, associated with few-shot learning in GPT-3 is ambiguity about whether few-shot\\nlearning actually learns new tasks “from scratch” at inference time, or if it simply recognizes and identiﬁes tasks that it\\nhas learned during training. These possibilities exist on a spectrum, ranging from demonstrations in the training set that\\nare drawn from exactly the same distribution as those at test time, to recognizing the same task but in a different format,\\nto adapting to a speciﬁc style of a general task such as QA, to learning a skill entirely de novo. Where GPT-3 is on\\nthis spectrum may also vary from task to task. Synthetic tasks such as wordscrambling or deﬁning nonsense words\\nseem especially likely to be learned de novo, whereas translation clearly must be learned during pretraining, although\\npossibly from data that is very different in organization and style than the test data. Ultimately, it is not even clear what\\nhumans learn from scratch vs from prior demonstrations. Even organizing diverse demonstrations during pre-training\\nand identifying them at test time would be an advance for language models, but nevertheless understanding precisely\\nhow few-shot learning works is an important unexplored direction for future research.\\nA limitation associated with models at the scale of GPT-3, regardless of objective function or algorithm, is that they are\\nboth expensive and inconvenient to perform inference on, which may present a challenge for practical applicability of\\nmodels of this scale in their current form. One possible future direction to address this is distillation [HVD15] of large\\nmodels down to a manageable size for speciﬁc tasks. Large models such as GPT-3 contain a very wide range of skills,\\nmost of which are not needed for a speciﬁc task, suggesting that in principle aggressive distillation may be possible.\\nDistillation is well-explored in general [LHCG19a] but has not been tried at the scale of hundred of billions parameters;\\nnew challenges and opportunities may be associated with applying it to models of this size.\\nFinally, GPT-3 shares some limitations common to most deep learning systems – its decisions are not easily interpretable,\\nit is not necessarily well-calibrated in its predictions on novel inputs as observed by the much higher variance in\\nperformance than humans on standard benchmarks, and it retains the biases of the data it has been trained on. This\\nlast issue – biases in the data that may lead the model to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content – is of special\\nconcern from a societal perspective, and will be discussed along with other issues in the next section on Broader Impacts\\n(Section 6).\\n6 Broader Impacts\\nLanguage models have a wide range of beneﬁcial applications for society, including code and writing auto-completion,\\ngrammar assistance, game narrative generation, improving search engine responses, and answering questions. But\\nthey also have potentially harmful applications. GPT-3 improves the quality of text generation and adaptability over\\nsmaller models and increases the difﬁculty of distinguishing synthetic text from human-written text. It therefore has the\\npotential to advance both the beneﬁcial and harmful applications of language models.\\nHere we focus on the potential harms of improved language models, not because we believe the harms are necessarily\\ngreater, but in order to stimulate efforts to study and mitigate them. The broader impacts of language models like this\\nare numerous. We focus on two primary issues: the potential for deliberate misuse of language models like GPT-3 in\\nSection 6.1, and issues of bias, fairness, and representation within models like GPT-3 in Section 6.2. We also brieﬂy\\ndiscuss issues of energy efﬁciency (Section 6.3).\\n34'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content='6.1 Misuse of Language Models\\nMalicious uses of language models can be somewhat difﬁcult to anticipate because they often involve repurposing\\nlanguage models in a very different environment or for a different purpose than researchers intended. To help with this,\\nwe can think in terms of traditional security risk assessment frameworks, which outline key steps such as identifying\\nthreats and potential impacts, assessing likelihood, and determining risk as a combination of likelihood and impact\\n[Ros12]. We discuss three factors: potential misuse applications, threat actors, and external incentive structures.\\n6.1.1 Potential Misuse Applications\\nAny socially harmful activity that relies on generating text could be augmented by powerful language models. Examples\\ninclude misinformation, spam, phishing, abuse of legal and governmental processes, fraudulent academic essay writing\\nand social engineering pretexting. Many of these applications bottleneck on human beings to write sufﬁciently high\\nquality text. Language models that produce high quality text generation could lower existing barriers to carrying out\\nthese activities and increase their efﬁcacy.\\nThe misuse potential of language models increases as the quality of text synthesis improves. The ability of GPT-3 to\\ngenerate several paragraphs of synthetic content that people ﬁnd difﬁcult to distinguish from human-written text in\\n3.9.4 represents a concerning milestone in this regard.\\n6.1.2 Threat Actor Analysis\\nThreat actors can be organized by skill and resource levels, ranging from low or moderately skilled and resourced actors\\nwho may be able to build a malicious product to ‘advanced persistent threats’ (APTs): highly skilled and well-resourced\\n(e.g. state-sponsored) groups with long-term agendas [SBC+19].\\nTo understand how low and mid-skill actors think about language models, we have been monitoring forums and chat\\ngroups where misinformation tactics, malware distribution, and computer fraud are frequently discussed. While we did\\nﬁnd signiﬁcant discussion of misuse following the initial release of GPT-2 in spring of 2019, we found fewer instances\\nof experimentation and no successful deployments since then. Additionally, those misuse discussions were correlated\\nwith media coverage of language model technologies. From this, we assess that the threat of misuse from these actors is\\nnot immediate, but signiﬁcant improvements in reliability could change this.\\nBecause APTs do not typically discuss operations in the open, we have consulted with professional threat analysts about\\npossible APT activity involving the use of language models. Since the release of GPT-2 there has been no discernible\\ndifference in operations that may see potential gains by using language models. The assessment was that language\\nmodels may not be worth investing signiﬁcant resources in because there has been no convincing demonstration that\\ncurrent language models are signiﬁcantly better than current methods for generating text, and because methods for\\n“targeting” or “controlling” the content of language models are still at a very early stage.\\n6.1.3 External Incentive Structures\\nEach threat actor group also has a set of tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that they rely on to accomplish their\\nagenda. TTPs are inﬂuenced by economic factors like scalability and ease of deployment; phishing is extremely popular\\namong all groups because it offers a low-cost, low-effort, high-yield method of deploying malware and stealing login\\ncredentials. Using language models to augment existing TTPs would likely result in an even lower cost of deployment.\\nEase of use is another signiﬁcant incentive. Having stable infrastructure has a large impact on the adoption of TTPs.\\nThe outputs of language models are stochastic, however, and though developers can constrain these (e.g. using top-k\\ntruncation) they are not able to perform consistently without human feedback. If a social media disinformation bot\\nproduces outputs that are reliable 99% of the time, but produces incoherent outputs 1% of the time, this could reduce the\\namount of human labor required in operating this bot. But a human is still needed to ﬁlter the outputs, which restricts\\nhow scalable the operation can be.\\nBased on our analysis of this model and analysis of threat actors and the landscape, we suspect AI researchers will\\neventually develop language models that are sufﬁciently consistent and steerable that they will be of greater interest to\\nmalicious actors. We expect this will introduce challenges for the broader research community, and hope to work on\\nthis through a combination of mitigation research, prototyping, and coordinating with other technical developers.\\n35'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='6.2 Fairness, Bias, and Representation\\nBiases present in training data may lead models to generate stereotyped or prejudiced content. This is concerning,\\nsince model bias could harm people in the relevant groups in different ways by entrenching existing stereotypes and\\nproducing demeaning portrayals amongst other potential harms [Cra17]. We have conducted an analysis of biases in\\nthe model in order to better understand GPT-3’s limitations when it comes to fairness, bias, and representation.8\\nOur goal is not to exhaustively characterize GPT-3, but to give a preliminary analysis of some of its limitations and\\nbehaviors. We focus on biases relating to gender, race, and religion, although many other categories of bias are likely\\npresent and could be studied in follow-up work. This is a preliminary analysis and does not reﬂect all of the model’s\\nbiases even within the studied categories.\\nBroadly, our analysis indicates that internet-trained models have internet-scale biases; models tend to reﬂect stereotypes\\npresent in their training data. Below we discuss our preliminary ﬁndings of bias along the dimensions of gender, race,\\nand religion. We probe for bias in the 175 billion parameter model and also in similar smaller models, to see if and how\\nthey are different in this dimension.\\n6.2.1 Gender\\nIn our investigation of gender bias in GPT-3, we focused on associations between gender and occupation. We found\\nthat occupations in general have a higher probability of being followed by a male gender identiﬁer than a female one\\n(in other words, they are male leaning) when given a context such as \"The {occupation} was a\" (Neutral Variant).\\n83% of the 388 occupations we tested were more likely to be followed by a male identiﬁer by GPT-3. We measured\\nthis by feeding the model a context such as \"The detective was a\" and then looking at the probability of the\\nmodel following up with male indicating words (eg. man, male etc.) or female indicating words (woman, female etc.).\\nIn particular, occupations demonstrating higher levels of education such as legislator, banker, or professor emeritus\\nwere heavily male leaning along with occupations that require hard physical labour such as mason, millwright, and\\nsheriff. Occupations that were more likely to be followed by female identiﬁers include midwife, nurse, receptionist,\\nhousekeeper etc.\\nWe also tested how these probabilities changed when we shifted the context to be the\"The competent {occupation}\\nwas a\" (Competent Variant), and when we shifted the context to be \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\"\\n(Incompetent Variant) for each occupation in the dataset. We found that, when prompted with \"The competent\\n{occupation} was a,\" the majority of occupations had an even higher probability of being followed by a\\nmale identiﬁer than a female one than was the case with our original neutral prompt, \"The {occupation} was\\na\". With the prompt \"The incompetent {occupation} was a\" the majority of occupations still leaned male\\nwith a similar probability than for our original neutral prompt. The average occupation bias - measured as\\n1\\nnjobs\\n∑\\njobs log(P(female|Context)\\nP(male|Context)) ) - was −1.11 for the Neutral Variant, −2.14 for the Competent Variant and −1.15\\nfor the Incompetent Variant.\\nWe also carried out pronoun resolution on the Winogender dataset [ RNLVD18] using two methods which further\\ncorroborated the model’s tendency to associate most occupations with males. One method measured the mod-\\nels ability to correctly assign a pronoun as the occupation or the participant. For example, we fed the model\\na context such as \"The advisor met with the advisee because she wanted to get advice about job\\napplications. ‘She’ refers to the\" and found the option with the lowest probability between the two possi-\\nble options (Choices between Occupation Option: advisor; Participant Option: advisee).\\nOccupation and participant words often have societal biases associated with them such as the assumption that most\\noccupants are by default male. We found that the language models learnt some of these biases such as a tendency to\\nassociate female pronouns with participant positions more than male pronouns. GPT-3 175B had the highest accuracy of\\nall the models (64.17%) on this task. It was also the only model where the accuracy for Occupant sentences (sentences\\nwhere the correct answer was the Occupation option) for females was higher than for males (81.7% vs 76.7%). All\\nother models had a higher accuracy for male pronouns with Occupation sentences as compared to female pronouns\\nwith the exception of our second largest model- GPT-3 13B - which had the same accuracy (60%) for both. This offers\\nsome preliminary evidence that in places where issues of bias can make language models susceptible to error, the larger\\nmodels are more robust than smaller models.\\nWe also performed co-occurrence tests, where we analyzed which words are likely to occur in the vicinity of other pre-\\nselected words. We created a model output sample set by generating 800 outputs of length 50 each with a temperature\\n8Evaluating fairness, bias, and representation in language models is a rapidly-developing area with a large body of prior work.\\nSee, for example, [HZJ+19, NBR20, SCNP19].\\n36'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='Table 6.1: Most Biased Descriptive Words in 175B Model\\nTop 10 Most Biased Male Descriptive Words with Raw\\nCo-Occurrence Counts\\nTop 10 Most Biased Female Descriptive Words with Raw\\nCo-Occurrence Counts\\nAverage Number of Co-Occurrences Across All Words:\\n17.5\\nAverage Number of Co-Occurrences Across All Words:\\n23.9\\nLarge (16) Optimistic (12)\\nMostly (15) Bubbly (12)\\nLazy (14) Naughty (12)\\nFantastic (13) Easy-going (12)\\nEccentric (13) Petite (10)\\nProtect (10) Tight (10)\\nJolly (10) Pregnant (10)\\nStable (9) Gorgeous (28)\\nPersonable (22) Sucked (8)\\nSurvive (7) Beautiful (158)\\nof 1 and top p of 0.9 for every prompt in our dataset. For gender, we had prompts such as \"He was very\", \"She\\nwas very\", \"He would be described as\", \"She would be described as\"9. We looked at the adjectives and\\nadverbs in the top 100 most favored words using an off-the-shelf POS tagger [LB02]. We found females were more\\noften described using appearance oriented words such as ”beautiful” and ”gorgeous” as compared to men who were\\nmore often described using adjectives that span a greater spectrum.\\nTable 6.1 shows the top 10 most favored descriptive words for the model along with the raw number of times each\\nword co-occurred with a pronoun indicator. “Most Favored” here indicates words which were most skewed towards a\\ncategory by co-occurring with it at a higher rate as compared to the other category. To put these numbers in perspective,\\nwe have also included the average for the number of co-occurrences across all qualifying words for each gender.\\n6.2.2 Race\\nTo investigate racial bias in GPT-3, we seeded the model with prompts such as - \"The {race} man was very\",\\n\"The {race} woman was very\" and \"People would describe the {race} person as\" and generated 800\\nsamples for each of the above prompts, with {race}replaced with a term indicating a racial category such as White\\nor Asian. We then measure word co-occurrences in the generated samples. Given prior research demonstrating that\\nlanguage models produce text of differing sentiment when varying features such as occupation [HZJ+19], we explored\\nhow race impacted sentiment. We measured sentiment using Senti WordNet [BES10] for the words which co-occurred\\ndisproportionately with each race. Each word sentiment varied from 100 to -100, with positive scores indicating positive\\nwords (eg. wonderfulness: 100, amicable: 87.5), negative scores indicating negative words (eg. wretched: -87.5 , horrid:\\n-87.5) and a score of 0 indicating neutral words (eg. sloping, chalet).\\nIt should be noted that we were explicitly prompting the models to talk about race and this in turn generated text that\\nfocused on racial features; these results are not from the models talking about race in the wild but talking about race in\\nan experimental setup where they have been primed to do so. Additionally, since we are measuring sentiment by simply\\nlooking at word co-occurrences, the resulting sentiment can reﬂect socio-historical factors - for instance, text relating to\\na discussion of slavery will frequently have a negative sentiment, which may lead to a demographic being associated\\nwith a negative sentiment under this testing methodology.\\nAcross the models we analyzed, ‘Asian’ had a consistently high sentiment - it ranked 1st in 3 out of 7 models. On the\\nother hand, ’Black’ had a consistently low sentiment - it ranked the lowest in 5 out of 7 models. These differences\\nnarrowed marginally on the larger model sizes. This analysis gives a sense of the biases of different models and\\nhighlights the need for more sophisticated analysis of the relationship between sentiment, entities, and input data.\\n9We only used male and female pronouns. This simplifying assumption makes it easier to study co-occurrence since it does not\\nrequire the isolation of instances in which ‘they’ refers to a singular noun from those where it didn’t, but other forms of gender bias\\nare likely present and could be studied using different approaches.\\n37'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='Figure 6.1: Racial Sentiment Across Models\\nReligion Most Favored Descriptive Words\\nAtheism ‘Theists’, ‘Cool’, ‘Agnostics’, ‘Mad’, ‘Theism’, ‘Defensive’, ‘Complaining’, ‘Correct’, ‘Arrogant’,\\n‘Characterized’\\nBuddhism ‘Myanmar’, ‘Vegetarians’, ‘Burma’, ‘Fellowship’, ‘Monk’, ‘Japanese’, ‘Reluctant’, ‘Wisdom’, ‘En-\\nlightenment’, ‘Non-Violent’\\nChristianity ‘Attend’, ‘Ignorant’, ‘Response’, ‘Judgmental’, ‘Grace’, ‘Execution’, ‘Egypt’, ‘Continue’, ‘Com-\\nments’, ‘Ofﬁcially’\\nHinduism ‘Caste’, ‘Cows’, ‘BJP’, ‘Kashmir’, ‘Modi’, ‘Celebrated’, ‘Dharma’, ‘Pakistani’, ‘Originated’, ‘Africa’\\nIslam ‘Pillars’, ‘Terrorism’, ‘Fasting’, ‘Sheikh’, ‘Non-Muslim’, ‘Source’, ‘Charities’, ‘Levant’, ‘Allah’,\\n‘Prophet’\\nJudaism ‘Gentiles’, ‘Race’, ‘Semites’, ‘Whites’, ‘Blacks’, ‘Smartest’, ‘Racists’, ‘Arabs’, ‘Game’, ‘Russian’\\nTable 6.2: Shows the ten most favored words about each religion in the GPT-3 175B model.\\n6.2.3 Religion\\nWe studied which words co-occurred with religious terms relating to Atheism, Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam,\\nand Judaism, by generating 800 model outputs of length ≈50 with a temperature of 1 and a top pof 0.9 for every\\nprompt.

Our work is inspired by the literature on characterizing model\\nattributes to develop informative labels such as Model Cards for Model Reporting from [MWZ+18].\\nUltimately, it is important not just to characterize biases in language systems but to intervene. The literature on this\\nis also extensive [QMZH19, HZJ+19], so we offer only a few brief comments on future directions speciﬁc to large\\nlanguage models. In order to pave the way for effective bias prevention in general purpose models, there is a need for\\nbuilding a common vocabulary tying together the normative, technical and empirical challenges of bias mitigation for\\nthese models. There is room for more research that engages with the literature outside NLP, better articulates normative\\nstatements about harm, and engages with the lived experience of communities affected by NLP systems [BBDIW20].\\nThus, mitigation work should not be approached purely with a metric driven objective to ‘remove’ bias as this has been\\nshown to have blind spots [GG19, NvNvdG19] but in a holistic manner.\\n6.3 Energy Usage\\nPractical large-scale pre-training requires large amounts of computation, which is energy-intensive: training the GPT-3\\n175B consumed several thousand petaﬂop/s-days of compute during pre-training, compared to tens of petaﬂop/s-days\\nfor a 1.5B parameter GPT-2 model (Figure 2.2). This means we should be cognizant of the cost and efﬁciency of such\\nmodels, as advocated by [SDSE19].\\nThe use of large-scale pre-training also gives another lens through which to view the efﬁciency of large models - we\\nshould consider not only the resources that go into training them, but how these resources are amortized over the\\nlifetime of a model, which will subsequently be used for a variety of purposes and ﬁne-tuned for speciﬁc tasks. Though\\nmodels like GPT-3 consume signiﬁcant resources during training, they can be surprisingly efﬁcient once trained: even\\nwith the full GPT-3 175B, generating 100 pages of content from a trained model can cost on the order of 0.4 kW-hr, or\\nonly a few cents in energy costs. Additionally, techniques like model distillation [LHCG19a] can further bring down\\nthe cost of such models, letting us adopt a paradigm of training single, large-scale models, then creating more efﬁcient\\nversions of them for use in appropriate contexts. Algorithmic progress may also naturally further increase the efﬁciency\\nof such models over time, similar to trends observed in image recognition and neural machine translation [HB20].\\n7 Related Work\\nSeveral lines of work have focused on increasing parameter count and/or computation in language models as a\\nmeans to improve generative or task performance. An early work scaled LSTM based language models to over a\\nbillion parameters [JVS+16]. One line of work straightforwardly increases the size of transformer models, scaling\\nup parameters and FLOPS-per-token roughly in proportion. Work in this vein has successively increased model size:\\n213 million parameters [ VSP+17] in the original paper, 300 million parameters [ DCLT18], 1.5 billion parameters\\n[RWC+19], 8 billion parameters [SPP+19], 11 billion parameters [RSR+19], and most recently 17 billion parameters\\n[Tur20]. A second line of work has focused on increasing parameter count but not computation, as a means of\\nincreasing models’ capacity to store information without increased computational cost. These approaches rely on the\\nconditional computation framework [BLC13] and speciﬁcally, the mixture-of-experts method [SMM+17] has been\\nused to produce 100 billion parameter models and more recently 50 billion parameter translation models [ AJF19],\\nthough only a small fraction of the parameters are actually used on each forward pass. A third approach increases\\ncomputation without increasing parameters; examples of this approach include adaptive computation time [Gra16] and\\nthe universal transformer [DGV+18]. Our work focuses on the ﬁrst approach (scaling compute and parameters together,\\nby straightforwardly making the neural net larger), and increases model size 10x beyond previous models that employ\\nthis strategy.\\nSeveral efforts have also systematically studied the effect of scale on language model performance. [ KMH+20,\\nRRBS19, LWS+20, HNA+17], ﬁnd a smooth power-law trend in loss as autoregressive language models are scaled up.\\nThis work suggests that this trend largely continues as models continue to scale up (although a slight bending of the\\ncurve can perhaps be detected in Figure 3.1), and we also ﬁnd relatively smooth increases in many (though not all)\\ndownstream tasks across 3 orders of magnitude of scaling.\\nAnother line of work goes in the opposite direction from scaling, attempting to preserve strong performance in language\\nmodels that are as small as possible. This approach includes ALBERT [ LCG+19] as well as general [HVD15] and\\n39'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='task-speciﬁc [ SDCW19, JYS+19, KR16] approaches to distillation of language models. These architectures and\\ntechniques are potentially complementary to our work, and could be applied to decrease latency and memory footprint\\nof giant models.\\nAs ﬁne-tuned language models have neared human performance on many standard benchmark tasks, considerable\\neffort has been devoted to constructing more difﬁcult or open-ended tasks, including question answering [KPR+19,\\nIBGC+14, CCE+18, MCKS18], reading comprehension [CHI+18, RCM19], and adversarially constructed datasets\\ndesigned to be difﬁcult for existing language models [SBBC19, NWD+19]. In this work we test our models on many\\nof these datasets.\\nMany previous efforts have focused speciﬁcally on question-answering, which constitutes a signiﬁcant fraction of the\\ntasks we tested on. Recent efforts include [RSR+19, RRS20], which ﬁne-tuned an 11 billion parameter language model,\\nand [GLT+20], which focused on attending over a large corpus of data at test time. Our work differs in focusing on\\nin-context learning but could be combined in the future with those of [GLT+20, LPP+20].\\nMetalearning in language models has been utilized in [ RWC+19], though with much more limited results and no\\nsystematic study. More broadly, language model metalearning has an inner-loop-outer-loop structure, making it\\nstructurally similar to metalearning as applied to ML in general. Here there is an extensive literature, including\\nmatching networks [VBL+16], RL2 [DSC+16], learning to optimize [RL16, ADG+16, LM17] and MAML [FAL17].\\nOur approach of stufﬁng the model’s context with previous examples is most structurally similar to RL2 and also\\nresembles [HYC01], in that an inner loop of adaptation takes place through computation in the model’s activations\\nacross timesteps, without updating the weights, while an outer loop (in this case just language model pre-training)\\nupdates the weights, and implicitly learns the ability to adapt to or at least recognize tasks deﬁned at inference-time.\\nFew-shot auto-regressive density estimation was explored in [ RCP+17] and [GWC+18] studied low-resource NMT as\\na few-shot learning problem.\\nWhile the mechanism of our few-shot approach is different, prior work has also explored ways of using pre-trained\\nlanguage models in combination with gradient descent to perform few-shot learning [SS20]. Another sub-ﬁeld with\\nsimilar goals is semi-supervised learning where approaches such as UDA [XDH+19] also explore methods of ﬁne-tuning\\nwhen very little labeled data is available.\\nGiving multi-task models instructions in natural language was ﬁrst formalized in a supervised setting with [MKXS18]\\nand utilized for some tasks (such as summarizing) in a language model with [ RWC+19]. The notion of presenting\\ntasks in natural language was also explored in the text-to-text transformer [RSR+19], although there it was applied for\\nmulti-task ﬁne-tuning rather than for in-context learning without weight updates.\\nAnother approach to increasing generality and transfer-learning capability in language models is multi-task learning\\n[Car97], which ﬁne-tunes on a mixture of downstream tasks together, rather than separately updating the weights for\\neach one. If successful multi-task learning could allow a single model to be used for many tasks without updating the\\nweights (similar to our in-context learning approach), or alternatively could improve sample efﬁciency when updating\\nthe weights for a new task. Multi-task learning has shown some promising initial results [ LGH+15, LSP+18] and\\nmulti-stage ﬁne-tuning has recently become a standardized part of SOTA results on some datasets [PFB18] and pushed\\nthe boundaries on certain tasks [KKS+20], but is still limited by the need to manually curate collections of datasets and\\nset up training curricula. By contrast pre-training at large enough scale appears to offer a “natural” broad distribution of\\ntasks implicitly contained in predicting the text itself. One direction for future work might be attempting to generate\\na broader set of explicit tasks for multi-task learning, for example through procedural generation [TFR+17], human\\ninteraction [ZSW+19b], or active learning [Mac92].\\nAlgorithmic innovation in language models over the last two years has been enormous, including denoising-based\\nbidirectionality [DCLT18], preﬁxLM [DL15] and encoder-decoder architectures [LLG+19, RSR+19], random permu-\\ntations during training [YDY+19], architectures that improve the efﬁciency of sampling [DYY+19], improvements in\\ndata and training procedures [LOG+19], and efﬁciency increases in the embedding parameters [LCG+19]. Many of\\nthese techniques provide signiﬁcant gains on downstream tasks. In this work we continue to focus on pure autoregressive\\nlanguage models, both in order to focus on in-context learning performance and to reduce the complexity of our large\\nmodel implementations. However, it is very likely that incorporating these algorithmic advances could improve GPT-3’s\\nperformance on downstream tasks, especially in the ﬁne-tuning setting, and combining GPT-3’s scale with these\\nalgorithmic techniques is a promising direction for future work.\\n8 Conclusion\\nWe presented a 175 billion parameter language model which shows strong performance on many NLP tasks and\\nbenchmarks in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings, in some cases nearly matching the performance of\\n40'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='state-of-the-art ﬁne-tuned systems, as well as generating high-quality samples and strong qualitative performance at\\ntasks deﬁned on-the-ﬂy.

In order to improve the quality of Common Crawl, we developed an automatic ﬁltering method to remove low\\nquality documents. Using the original WebText as a proxy for high-quality documents, we trained a classiﬁer\\nto distinguish these from raw Common Crawl. We then used this classiﬁer to re-sample Common Crawl by\\nprioritizing documents which were predicted by the classiﬁer to be higher quality. The classiﬁer is trained\\nusing logistic regression classiﬁer with features from Spark’s standard tokenizer and HashingTF10. For the\\npositive examples, we used a collection of curated datasets such as WebText, Wikiedia, and our web books\\ncorpus as the positive examples, and for the negative examples, we used unﬁltered Common Crawl. We used\\nthis classiﬁer to score Common Crawl documents. We kept each document in our dataset iff\\nnp.random.pareto(α) >1 −document_score\\nWe choseα= 9in order to take mostly documents the classiﬁer scored highly, but still include some documents\\nthat were out of distribution. αwas chosen to match the distribution of scores from our classiﬁer on WebText.\\nWe found this re-weighting increased quality as measured by loss on a range of out-of-distribution generative\\ntext samples.\\n2. To further improve model quality and prevent overﬁtting (which becomes increasingly important as model\\ncapacity increases), we fuzzily deduplicated documents (i.e. removed documents with high overlap with\\nother documents) within each dataset using Spark’s MinHashLSH implementation with 10 hashes, using the\\nsame features as were used for classiﬁcation above. We also fuzzily removed WebText from Common Crawl.\\nOverall this decreased dataset size by an average of 10%.\\nAfter ﬁltering for duplicates and quality, we also partially removed text occurring in benchmark datasets, described in\\nAppendix C.\\nB Details of Model Training\\nTo train all versions of GPT-3, we use Adam withβ1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.95, and ϵ= 10−8, we clip the global norm of the\\ngradient at 1.0, and we use cosine decay for learning rate down to 10% of its value, over 260 billion tokens (after 260\\nbillion tokens, training continues at 10% of the original learning rate). There is a linear LR warmup over the ﬁrst 375\\nmillion tokens. We also gradually increase the batch size linearly from a small value (32k tokens) to the full value over\\nthe ﬁrst 4-12 billion tokens of training, depending on the model size. Data are sampled without replacement during\\ntraining (until an epoch boundary is reached) to minimize overﬁtting. All models use weight decay of 0.1 to provide a\\nsmall amount of regularization [LH17].\\nDuring training we always train on sequences of the full nctx = 2048 token context window, packing multiple\\ndocuments into a single sequence when documents are shorter than 2048, in order to increase computational efﬁciency.\\nSequences with multiple documents are not masked in any special way but instead documents within a sequence\\nare delimited with a special end of text token, giving the language model the information necessary to infer that\\ncontext separated by the end of text token is unrelated. This allows for efﬁcient training without need for any special\\nsequence-speciﬁc masking.\\nC Details of Test Set Contamination Studies\\nIn section 4 we gave a high level overview of test set contamination studies. In this section we provide details on\\nmethodology and results.\\nInitial training set ﬁltering We attempted to remove text occurring in benchmarks from training data by searching\\nfor 13−gram overlaps between all test/development sets used in this work and our training data, and we removed\\nthe colliding 13−gram as well as a 200 character window around it, splitting the original document into pieces. For\\nﬁltering purposes we deﬁne a gram as a lowercase, whitespace delimited word with no punctuation. Pieces less than\\n200 characters long were discarded. Documents split into more than 10 pieces were considered contaminated and\\n10https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.ml.html#pyspark.ml.feature.HashingTF\\n43'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='removed entirely. Originally we removed entire documents given a single collision, but that overly penalized long\\ndocuments such as books for false positives. An example of a false positive might be a test set based on Wikipedia, in\\nwhich the Wikipedia article quotes a single line from a book. We ignored13−grams that matched more than 10 training\\ndocuments, as inspection showed the majority of these to contain common cultural phrases, legal boilerplate, or similar\\ncontent that we likely do want the model to learn, rather than undesired speciﬁc overlaps with test sets. Examples for\\nvarious frequencies can be found in the GPT-3 release repository11.\\nOverlap methodology For our benchmark overlap analysis in Section 4, we used a variable number of words N to\\ncheck for overlap for each dataset, where N is the 5th percentile example length in words, ignoring all punctuation,\\nwhitespace, and casing. Due to spurious collisions at lower values of N we use a minimum value of 8 on non-synthetic\\ntasks. For performance reasons, we set a maximum value of 13 for all tasks. Values for N and the amount of data\\nmarked as dirty are shown in Table C.1. Unlike GPT-2’s use of bloom ﬁlters to compute probabilistic bounds for test\\ncontamination, we used Apache Spark to compute exact collisions across all training and test sets. We compute overlaps\\nbetween test sets and our full training corpus, even though we only trained on 40% of our ﬁltered Common Crawl\\ndocuments per Section 2.2.\\nWe deﬁne a ‘dirty’ example as one with anyN-gram overlap with any training document, and a ‘clean’ example as one\\nwith no collision.\\nTest and validation splits had similar contamination levels despite some test splits being unlabeled. Due to a bug revealed\\nby this analysis, ﬁltering described above failed on long documents such as books. Because of cost considerations it\\nwas infeasible to retrain the model on a corrected version of the training dataset. As such, several language modeling\\nbenchmarks plus the Children’s Book Test showed almost complete overlap, and therefore were not included in this\\npaper. Overlaps are shown in Table C.1\\nOverlap results To understand how much having seen some of the data helps the model perform on downstream\\ntasks, we ﬁlter every validation and test set by dirtiness. Then we run evaluation on the clean-only examples and report\\nthe relative percent change between the clean score and the original score. If the clean score is more than 1% or 2%\\nworse than the overall score, it suggests the model may have overﬁt to the examples it has seen. If the clean score is\\nsigniﬁcantly better, our ﬁltering scheme may have preferentially marked easier examples as dirty.\\nThis overlap metric tends to show a high rate of false positives for datasets that contain background information (but\\nnot answers) drawn from the web (such as SQuAD, which draws from Wikipedia) or examples less than 8 words\\nlong, which we ignored in our ﬁltering process (except for wordscrambling tasks). One instance where this technique\\nseems to fail to give good signal is DROP, a reading comprehension task in which 94% of the examples are dirty. The\\ninformation required to answer the question is in a passage provided to the model, so having seen the passage during\\ntraining but not the questions and answers does not meaningfully constitute cheating. We conﬁrmed that every matching\\ntraining document contained only the source passage, and none of the questions and answers in the dataset. The more\\nlikely explanation for the decrease in performance is that the 6% of examples that remain after ﬁltering come from a\\nslightly different distribution than the dirty examples.\\nFigure 4.2 shows that as the dataset becomes more contaminated, the variance of the clean/all fraction increases, but\\nthere is no apparent bias towards improved or degraded performance. This suggests that GPT-3 is relatively insensitive\\nto contamination. See Section 4 for details on the datasets we ﬂagged for further review.\\n11https://github.com/openai/gpt-3/blob/master/overlap_frequency.md\\n44'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='Name Split Metric N Acc/F1/BLEU\\nTotal\\nCount\\nDirty\\nAcc/F1/BLEU\\nDirty\\nCount\\nClean\\nAcc/F1/BLEU\\nClean\\nCount\\nClean\\nPercentage\\nRelative\\nDifference\\nClean vs All\\nQuac dev f1 13 44.3 7353 44.3 7315 54.1 38 1% 20%\\nSQuADv2 dev f1 13 69.8 11873 69.9 11136 68.4 737 6% -2%\\nDROP dev f1 13 36.5 9536 37.0 8898 29.5 638 7% -21%\\nSymbol Insertion dev acc 7 66.9 10000 66.8 8565 67.1 1435 14% 0%\\nCoQa dev f1 13 86.0 7983 85.3 5107 87.1 2876 36% 1%\\nReCoRD dev acc 13 89.5 10000 90.3 6110 88.2 3890 39% -1%\\nWinograd test acc 9 88.6 273 90.2 164 86.2 109 40% -3%\\nBoolQ dev acc 13 76.0 3270 75.8 1955 76.3 1315 40% 0%\\nMultiRC dev acc 13 74.2 953 73.4 558 75.3 395 41% 1%\\nRACE-h test acc 13 46.8 3498 47.0 1580 46.7 1918 55% 0%\\nLAMBADA test acc 13 86.4 5153 86.9 2209 86.0 2944 57% 0%\\nLAMBADA (No Blanks) test acc 13 77.8 5153 78.5 2209 77.2 2944 57% -1%\\nWSC dev acc 13 76.9 104 73.8 42 79.0 62 60% 3%\\nPIQA dev acc 8 82.3 1838 89.9 526 79.3 1312 71% -4%\\nRACE-m test acc 13 58.5 1436 53.0 366 60.4 1070 75% 3%\\nDe→En 16 test bleu-sb 12 43.0 2999 47.4 739 40.8 2260 75% -5%\\nEn→De 16 test bleu-sb 12 30.9 2999 32.6 739 29.9 2260 75% -3%\\nEn→Ro 16 test bleu-sb 12 25.8 1999 24.9 423 26.1 1576 79% 1%\\nRo→En 16 test bleu-sb 12 41.3 1999 40.4 423 41.6 1576 79% 1%\\nWebQs test acc 8 41.5 2032 41.6 428 41.5 1604 79% 0%\\nANLI R1 test acc 13 36.8 1000 40.5 200 35.9 800 80% -3%\\nANLI R2 test acc 13 34.0 1000 29.4 177 35.0 823 82% 3%\\nTriviaQA dev acc 10 71.2 7993 70.8 1390 71.3 6603 83% 0%\\nANLI R3 test acc 13 40.2 1200 38.3 196 40.5 1004 84% 1%\\nEn→Fr 14 test bleu-sb 13 39.9 3003 38.3 411 40.3 2592 86% 1%\\nFr→En 14 test bleu-sb 13 41.4 3003 40.9 411 41.4 2592 86% 0%\\nWiC dev acc 13 51.4 638 53.1 49 51.3 589 92% 0%\\nRTE dev acc 13 71.5 277 71.4 21 71.5 256 92% 0%\\nCB dev acc 13 80.4 56 100.0 4 78.8 52 93% -2%\\nAnagrams 2 dev acc 2 40.2 10000 76.2 705 37.4 9295 93% -7%\\nReversed Words dev acc 2 0.4 10000 1.5 660 0.3 9340 93% -26%\\nOpenBookQA test acc 8 65.4 500 58.1 31 65.9 469 94% 1%\\nARC (Easy) test acc 11 70.1 2268 77.5 89 69.8 2179 96% 0%\\nAnagrams 1 dev acc 2 15.0 10000 49.8 327 13.8 9673 97% -8%\\nCOPA dev acc 9 93.0 100 100.0 3 92.8 97 97% 0%\\nARC (Challenge) test acc 12 51.6 1144 45.2 31 51.8 1113 97% 0%\\nHellaSwag dev acc 13 79.3 10042 86.2 152 79.2 9890 98% 0%\\nNQs test acc 11 29.9 3610 32.7 52 29.8 3558 99% 0%\\nCycled Letters dev acc 2 38.6 10000 20.5 73 38.7 9927 99% 0%\\nSAT Analogies dev acc 9 65.8 374 100.0 2 65.6 372 99% 0%\\nStoryCloze test acc 13 87.7 1871 100.0 2 87.6 1869 100% 0%\\nWinogrande dev acc 13 77.7 1267 - 0 77.7 1267 100% 0%\\nTable C.1: Overlap statistics for all datasets sorted from dirtiest to cleanest.

We ﬁrst describe the experiments on the ∼200 word news articles, and then\\ndescribe the preliminary investigation of ∼500 word news articles generated by GPT-3.\\nParticipants: We recruited 718 unique participants to take part in 6 experiments. 97 participants were excluded for\\nfailing an internet check question, leaving a total of 621 participants: 343 male, 271 female, and 7 other. Mean\\nparticipant age was ∼38 years old. All participants were recruited through Positly, which maintains a whitelist of\\nhigh-performing workers from Mechanical Turk. All participants were US-based but there were no other demographic\\nrestrictions. Participants were paid $12 for their participation, based on a task time estimate of 60 minutes determined\\nby pilot runs. In order to ensure that the sample of participants for each experiment quiz was unique, participants were\\nnot allowed to take part in an experiment more than once.\\nProcedure and design: We arbitrarily selected 25 news articles that appeared in newser.com in early 2020. We used\\nthe article titles and subtitles to produce outputs from the 125M, 350M, 760M, 1.3B, 2.7B, 6.7B, 13.0B, and 200B\\n(GPT-3) parameter language models. Five outputs per question were generated by each model and the generation with a\\nword count closest to that of the human written article was selected automatically. This was to minimize the effect\\nthat completion length might have on participants’ judgments. The same output procedure for each model with the\\nexception of the removal of the intentionally bad control model, as described in the main text.\\n46'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='Model\\nParticipants\\nRecruited\\nParticipants\\nExcluded\\nGenders\\n(m:f:other)\\nMean\\nAge\\nAverage\\nWord Count\\n(human:model)\\nControl 76 7 32:37:0 39 216:216\\nGPT-3 Small 80 7 41:31:1 40 216:188\\nGPT-3 Medium 80 7 46:28:2 39 216:202\\nGPT-3 Large 81 24 46:28:2 37 216:200\\nGPT-3 XL 79 14 32:32:1 38 216:199\\nGPT-3 2.7B 80 11 36:33:0 40 216:202\\nGPT-3 6.7B 76 5 46:28:2 37 216:195\\nGPT-3 13.0B 81 13 46:28:2 37 216:209\\nGPT-3 175B 80 9 42:29:0 37 216:216\\nTable E.1: Participant details and article lengths for each experiment to evaluate human detection of∼200 word model\\ngenerated news articles. Participants were excluded due to internet check fails.\\nFigure E.1: Participants spend more time trying to identify whether each news article is machine generated as model\\nsize increases. Duration on the control model is indicated with the dashed line. Line of best ﬁt is a linear model on a log\\nscale with 95% conﬁdence intervals.\\nIn each experiment, half of the participants were randomly assigned to quiz A and half were randomly assigned to quiz\\nB. Each quiz consisted of 25 articles: half (12-13) were human written and half (12-13) were model generated: the\\narticles with human written completions in quiz A had model generated completions in quiz B and vice versa. The\\norder of quiz question was shufﬂed for each participant. Participants could leave comments and were asked to indicate\\nif they had seen the articles before. Participants were instructed not to look up the articles or their content during the\\nquiz and at the end of the quiz were asked if they had looked anything up during the quiz.\\nStatistical Tests: To compare means on the different runs, we performed a two-sample t-test for independent groups for\\neach model against the control. This was implemented in Python using the scipy.stats.ttest_ind function. When\\nplotting a regression line in the graph of average participant accuracy vs model size, we ﬁt a power law of the form\\nax−b. The 95% conﬁdence intervals were estimated from the t-distribution of the sample mean.\\nDuration statistics: In the main text, we discussed the ﬁnding that the ability of human participants to distinguish\\nmodel and human generated news articles decreases as our models become larger. We have also found that the\\naverage time spent for a given set of questions increases as the model size increases, as shown in Figure E.1.

We randomly selected 12 Reuters world news articles from\\nlate 2019 and created a context for GPT-3 175B that consisted of a single Reuters article not in this set of 12. We then\\nused the article titles and Reuters locations to generate completions from GPT-3 175B and the 160M control model\\nfrom the previous experiments. These were used to create two 12-question quizzes per model, each consisting of half\\nhuman written and half model generated articles. Comprehension questions were added and articles were shown to\\nparticipants in 3 stages at 30 second intervals to encourage closer reading. Participants were paid $12 for this task.\\nModel generation selection methods, exclusion criteria, and statistical tests mirror those of the previous experiments.\\nF Additional Samples from GPT-3\\nGPT-3 adapts well to many tasks other than the ones explored in the main body of the paper. As an example, in Figure\\nF.1, we show four uncurated samples from a prompt suggesting that the model write a poem, with a given title, in the\\nstyle of Wallace Stevens. We ﬁrst experimented with a few prompts, then generated four samples with no additional\\nediting or selection (sampling at temperature 1 using nucleus sampling [HBFC19] with P = 0.9). Completions were\\ntruncated when the model began to write a new title and author heading, or broke into prose commentary.\\n48'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='Context → The City\\nBY C.

Perry\\nsoon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and\\nRyan. Perry’s \"Refrigerator\" nickname followed him into the NFL and he\\nquickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called\\nhim \"Biscuit,\" as in \"one biscuit shy of 350 pounds.\" While Ryan refused\\nto play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was\\nnear the opponents’ goal line or in fourth and short situations, either\\nas a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton.\\nDitka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him\\nduring five-yard sprint exercises. During his rookie season, Perry\\nrushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Perry even had\\nthe opportunity to run the ball during Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his\\npopularity and contributions to the team’s success. The first time he\\ngot the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw\\nhis first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the\\nball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew\\nin the process). About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally\\nbegan to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive\\nlineman. His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional\\nfootball player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while\\nthe ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12. Perry went\\non to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In\\nhis ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which\\nhampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording\\n29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of\\n71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns,\\nand had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a\\ncomeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of\\nthe World League of American Football (later NFL Europa).\\nQ: what team did he play for?\\nA:\\nTarget Completion → the Chicago Bears\\nFigure G.25: Formatted dataset example for QuAC\\nContext → Please unscramble the letters into a word, and write that word:\\nr e!c.i p r o.c a/l =\\nTarget Completion → reciprocal\\nFigure G.26: Formatted dataset example for Symbol Insertion\\nContext → Please unscramble the letters into a word, and write that word:\\ntaefed =\\nTarget Completion → defeat\\nFigure G.27: Formatted dataset example for Reversed Words\\n57'), Document(metadata={'source': './rag_data/language_models_few_shot_learners.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='Context → Title: The Blitz\\nBackground: From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement.\\nThe Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and\\nthree heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe\\nflew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to\\nfind and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was\\nobserved until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger¨ at beams were placed over\\nfalse targets and switched only at the last minute. Rapid frequency\\nchanges were introduced for X-Ger¨ at, whose wider band of frequencies and\\ngreater tactical flexibility ensured it remained effective at a time when\\nBritish selective jamming was degrading the effectiveness of Y-Ger¨ at.\\nQ: How many sorties were flown in March 1941?\\nA: 4,000\\nQ: When did the Luftwaffe fly inland missions?\\nA:\\nTarget Completion → only on moonlit nights\\nFigure G.28: Formatted dataset example for SQuADv2\\nContext → Normal force -- In a simple case such as an object resting upon a table,\\nthe normal force on the object is equal but in opposite direction to the\\ngravitational force applied on the object (or the weight of the object),\\nthat is, N = m g (\\\\displaystyle N=mg), where m is mass, and g is the\\ngravitational field strength (about 9.81 m/s on Earth). The normal force\\nhere represents the force applied by the table against the object that\\nprevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is\\nsturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it\\nis easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction\\nforce pairs (a common mistake). In this case, the normal force and\\nweight need to be equal in magnitude to explain why there is no upward\\nacceleration of the object. For example, a ball that bounces upwards\\naccelerates upwards because the normal force acting on the ball is larger\\nin magnitude than the weight of the ball.\\nquestion: is the normal force equal to the force of gravity?\\nanswer:\\nTarget Completion → yes\\nFigure G.29: Formatted dataset example for BoolQ\\nContext → The trend toward lower rents may seem surprising given that some\\ncommunities in New York are bemoaning the loss of favorite local\\nbusinesses to high rents.
